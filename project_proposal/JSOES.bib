abstract = {Climate-driven changes in the oceans, such as shifts in prey timing and abundance, could influence variability in population productivity of marine fishes. For example, according to the match/mismatch hypothesis, the temporal matching of the young salmon outmigration from freshwater to the ocean relative to the timing of availability of their prey could influence their marine survival. Indeed, understanding patterns and processes of marine survival is particularly pressing in many salmon and steelhead trout populations due to recent declines. To determine whether phenological mismatches between juvenile salmonids and their prey could contribute to low ocean survival, we analyzed the migration timing and ocean survival of 22,116 tagged juvenile steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss over 12 years from the Wind River, Washington State, USA. We used a Bayesian multilevel modelling approach with variable selection to assess how survival was associated with body size, river exit date, the biological spring transition date (the day when northern zooplankton first appeared in the coastal region near the Columbia River estuary), and the degree of mismatch (the effect of the interaction between individual outmigration timing and biological spring transition date). The variables with the highest probability of contributing to individual survival were fish size (100%), river exit date (99%), the interaction between year and river exit date (91%), and the biological spring transition date (64%). Fish that were larger than average at outmigration had higher ocean survival, providing further evidence that freshwater growing conditions have carryover effects on marine survival. Years with greater annual phenological mismatches such as those years with late biological spring transition dates (i.e., occurring after June 1st), or warm sea surface temperatures, had sufficiently low marine survival to compromise recovery goals. Substantial intra-annual variation in outmigration timing buffered the population from inter-annual variation in optimal outmigration timing. Collectively these findings indicate that freshwater growing conditions, migration timing, and the timing of high-quality food availability in the nearshore coastal environment work in concert to influence individual survival and annual smolt-to-adult returns.},

abstract = {As we confront novel environmental challenges, a full understanding of the physical and biological processes that govern species responses to climate change will help maintain biodiversity and support conservation measures that are more robust to irreducible uncertainty. However, climate impacts are so complex, and the literature on salmon and trout is so vast that researchers and decision makers scramble to make sense of it all. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of climate impacts on salmon and anadromous trout as a resource for stakeholders, managers, and researchers. We reviewed studies published from 2010 to 2021 that address climate impacts on these fish and organized them in a database of 1169 physical and 1853 biological papers. Papers are labeled with keywords across eight categories related to subject matter and study methods. We compared the literature by biological process and life stage and used these comparisons to assess strengths and weaknesses. We then summarized expected phenotypic and genetic responses and management actions by life stage. Overall, we found the largest research gaps related to species interactions, behavioral responses, and effects that carry over across life stages. With this collection of the literature, we can better apply scarce conservation resources, fill knowledge gaps, and make informed decisions that do not ignore uncertainty.},

abstract = {Experiences of migratory species in one habitat may affect their survival in the next habitat, in what is known as carryover effects. These effects are especially relevant for understanding how freshwater experience affects survival in anadromous fishes. Here, we study the carryover effects of juvenile salmon passage through a hydropower system (Snake and Columbia rivers, northwestern United States). To reduce the direct effect of hydrosystem passage on juveniles, some fishes are transported through the hydrosystem in barges, while the others are allowed to migrate in-river. Although hydrosystem survival of transported fishes is greater than that of their run-of-river counterparts, their relative juvenile-to-adult survival (hereafter survival) can be less. We tested for carryover effects using generalized linear mixed effects models of survival with over 1 million tagged Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum) (Salmonidae), migrating in 1999–2013. Carryover effects were identified with rear-type (wild vs. hatchery), passage-type (run-of-river vs. transported), and freshwater and marine covariates. Importantly, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index characterizing cool/warm (i.e., productive/nonproductive) ocean phases had a strong influence on the relative survival of rear- and passage-types. Specifically, transportation benefited wild Chinook salmon more in cool PDO years, while hatchery counterparts benefited more in warm PDO years. Transportation was detrimental for wild Chinook salmon migrating early in the season, but beneficial for later season migrants. Hatchery counterparts benefited from transportation throughout the season. Altogether, wild fish could benefit from transportation approximately 2 weeks earlier during cool PDO years, with still a benefit to hatchery counterparts. Furthermore, we found some support for hypotheses related to higher survival with increased river flow, high predation in the estuary and plume areas, and faster migration and development-related increased survival with temperature. Thus, pre- and within-season information on local- and broad-scale conditions across habitats can be useful for planning and implementing real-time conservation programs.},

abstract = {Many marine species are shifting their distributions in response to changing ocean conditions, posing significant challenges and risks for fisheries management. Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to project future species distributions in the face of a changing climate. Information to fit SDMs generally comes from two main sources: fishery-independent (scientific surveys) and fishery-dependent (commercial catch) data. A concern with fishery-dependent data is that fishing locations are not independent of the underlying species abundance, potentially biasing predictions of species distributions. However, resources for fishery-independent surveys are increasingly limited; therefore, it is critical we understand the strengths and limitations of SDMs developed from fishery-dependent data. We used a simulation approach to evaluate the potential for fishery-dependent data to inform SDMs and abundance estimates and quantify the bias resulting from different fishery-dependent sampling scenarios in the California Current System (CCS). We then evaluated the ability of the SDMs to project changes in the spatial distribution of species over time and compare the time scale over which model performance degrades between the different sampling scenarios and as a function of climate bias and novelty. Our results show that data generated from fishery-dependent sampling can still result in SDMs with high predictive skill several decades into the future, given specific forms of preferential sampling which result in low climate bias and novelty. Therefore, fishery-dependent data may be able to supplement information from surveys that are reduced or eliminated for budgetary reasons to project species distributions into the future.},

Coincident with this marine heat wave, we documented unprecedented biological changes in plankton and nekton in the Northern California Current (NCC) within pelagic surveys conducted over 20 years (1998–2017). The recent warm period was dominated by warmwater gelatinous invertebrates and fishes, some of which were previously either extremely rare or absent. Mixing of organisms originating from more southern or western regions with those previously present in the NCC may have resulted in novel and unpredictable trophic interactions that produced some of the observed changes in relative abundance. Continued long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether this is a temporary ecosystem disturbance or a fundamental change in the very productive NCC upwelling region.},

abstract = {Predation risk, the probability that a prey animal will be killed by a predator, is fundamental to theoretical and applied ecology. Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator–prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator–prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator–prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions.},

abstract = {Aim: Long-term monitoring data at the biogeographic scale are essential for developing baselines of biodiversity patterns and tools to diagnose natural cycles, trends, and anomalous events to assess threats from climate change. However, studies using these data often limit their analyses to relatively few metrics that may not adequately capture the breadth of biodiversity. Here, we calculate a suite of compositional and functional biodiversity metrics—collectively comprising ecoscapes—to better resolve assemblage-level responses to environmental variability and test the spatiotemporal lability of faunal biogeographic provinces. Location: California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME). Taxon: Young-of-the-year juvenile groundfish assemblages (n = 45 taxa). Methods: Species composition and abundance data from two long-term fisheries-independent surveys were collated with a functional trait database for pelagic taxa. Distinct assemblages were identified through cluster analysis. Compositional and functional alpha- and beta-level biodiversity metrics were then calculated to characterise assemblage-level biodiversity and to identify patterns of regional community composition and turnover in space and time. Results: Ecoscapes revealed the assemblage structure, functional diversity, and turnover of juvenile groundfish from 1990 to 2023. Canonical CCLME biogeographic provinces were mostly supported, but with notable spatiotemporal variation and differences across compositional and functional diversity metrics. Highly productive (unproductive) years were associated with the widespread extent of assemblages characterised by high (low) biodiversity and abundance. Main Conclusions: The differences between patterns of functional and compositional diversity of assemblages highlight the potential of ecoscapes to better resolve biogeographic patterns with promising applications for future studies. Ecoscapes may provide explicit links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services, and additional insights into assemblage responses and resilience to environmental variability that can aid biodiversity monitoring and rapidly disseminate management-relevant information in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Determining which factors are most effective for mitigative strategies in conservation management can be difficult for species with complex life cycles. Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating through a hydroelectric power system experience conditions that can affect their survival directly within a life stage and indirectly in subsequent life stages through carryover effects. We quantified the association of covariates with survival across life stages of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha): juveniles migrating downstream, juveniles in the estuary, subadults in the ocean, and adults migrating upstream. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian mark–recapture model to $\sim$400,000 wild Snake River Chinook salmon (Pacific Northwest, USA). Modeled covariates of survival included migration timing, river temperature, flow, percent of water spilled over dams, snow water equivalent, juvenile fish transportation, juvenile fish length, dam powerhouse passage, sea surface temperature, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. By analyzing these covariates in a unified model, we evaluated their relationships to survival within and across life stages in a common currency. Among direct effects, the negative relationship of sea surface temperature to ocean survival had the largest marginal effect size. Carryover effects also had substantial marginal effect sizes. Ocean survival was associated positively with juvenile length and snow water equivalent and negatively with river temperature. In comparison, direct effects on juvenile and adult survival generally showed smaller marginal effect sizes. Both juvenile and adult survival were negatively associated with river temperature. Juvenile survival increased with fish length, while adult survival was positively related to flow and negatively to percent water spilled at dams. The greatest variability in survival, however, was in the ocean stage. Thus, as the ocean continues to warm and as the human population exerts more pressure on the ecosystem, carryover effects will be increasingly important for recovering salmon and other migratory species.},

abstract = {Due to spatio-temporal variability of lower trophic-level productivity along the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), predators must be capable of switching prey or foraging areas in response to changes in environmental conditions and available forage. The Gulf of the Farallones in central California represents a biodiversity hotspot and contains the largest common murre (Uria aalge) colonies along the CCE. During spring, one of the West Coast's most important Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations out-migrates into the Gulf of the Farallones. We quantify the effect of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon associated with ecosystem-level variability by integrating long-term time series of environmental conditions (upwelling, river discharge), forage species abundance within central CCE, and population size, at-sea distribution, and diet of the common murre. Our results demonstrate common murres typically forage in the vicinity of their offshore breeding sites, but in years in which their primary prey, pelagic young-of-year rockfish (Sebastes spp.), are less available they forage for adult northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) nearshore. Incidentally, while foraging inshore, common murre consumption of out-migrating juvenile Chinook salmon, which are collocated with northern anchovy, increases and population survival of the salmon is significantly reduced. Results support earlier findings that show timing and strength of upwelling, and the resultant forage fish assemblage, is related to Chinook salmon recruitment variability in the CCE, but we extend those results by demonstrating the significance of top-down impacts associated with these bottom-up dynamics. Our results demonstrate the complexity of ecosystem interactions and impacts between higher trophic-level predators and their prey, complexities necessary to quantify in order to parameterize ecosystem models and evaluate likely outcomes of ecosystem management options.},

This prompted the development and implementation of two separate management plans, one in the Columbia River estuary and the other in the Columbia Plateau region, to reduce the impact of Caspian tern predation on smolt survival. Caspian terns nesting at managed breeding colonies within the basin were relocated to alternative nesting islands created for terns outside the basin. Both plans were successful in significantly reducing smolt losses to Caspian terns nesting at managed sites; however, new developments have led to regression in smolt survival gains associated with tern management. Adaptive management to prevent terns at managed colonies from relocating to nest elsewhere in the basin and to improve nesting opportunities for Caspian terns outside the basin are needed to maximize the survival benefits to Endangered Species Act-listed salmonids from management. Adaptive management is also necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the Pacific Flyway population of Caspian terns, whose breeding population has declined by more than 50% since the two management plans were implemented.},

Fluctuations in predatory fish species composition and abundance were strongly linked to the date of the spring transition and to ocean temperatures. Predatory fishes, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonids had distinct spatial distributions, with predators distributed primarily offshore and forage fish and salmonids onshore, but this varied depending on ocean conditions. We suggest that predatory and forage fish distributions respond to ocean temperatures, predator/prey interactions, and possibly turbidity. A shift in ocean conditions in 1999 decreased overall predator fish abundance in the Columbia River plume, particularly for Pacific hake.

Data to inform species distribution models are available from several fishery-independent surveys. However, no single survey covers the entire region and different gear types are required to survey the range of relevant habitat. Here, we demonstrated a method for integrating presence–absence data across surveys and gear types that allows us to predict the coastwide distributions of 65 groundfish species in British Columbia. Our model leverages data from multiple surveys to estimate how species respond to environmental gradients while accounting for differences in survey catchability. We find that this method has two main benefits: (1) it increases the accuracy of predictions in data-limited surveys and regions while having negligible impacts on accuracy when data are already sufficient, and (2) it reduces uncertainty, resulting in tighter confidence intervals on predicted occurrences. These benefits are particularly relevant in areas of our coast where our understanding of habitat suitability is limited due to a lack of spatially comprehensive long-term groundfish surveys.},

abstract = { Predation by piscivorous marine fishes has been hypothesized to be a primary source of marine mortality for Pacific Northwest juvenile salmon. During the springs and summers of 1998‐2004, we collected predator and prey fishes (forage and juvenile salmonids) at the surface at night off the mouth of the Columbia River. Pacific hake Merluccius productus had relatively low percentages of empty stomachs during cool‐ocean years (2000 through 2002) and high percentages during 1998, a warm‐ocean year. Euphausiids and fishes were the most commonly eaten prey for both species. Pacific hake and jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus appeared to show some diet selectivity, eating some fish, including salmonids, in a higher proportion than found in the environment. Both Pacific hake and jack mackerel ate juvenile salmonids, but at very low amounts.

abstract = {Euphausiids, or krill, are important energy links between primary producers and higher trophic levels in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), but a thorough understanding of their variability at the coast-wide scale is limited. Using fisheries acoustics data collected during biennial joint US-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Acoustic Trawl Surveys for Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), we developed a time series (n = 8 years; 2007-2019 odd years inclusive, and 2012) of krill abundance and examined relationships with environmental factors. Krill were located in waters off the west coasts of the United States and Canada, primarily in shallow basins and on the continental shelf, with greatest kernel density estimates near Cape Mendocino and the Juan de Fuca eddy system. Coast-wide krill abundance was variable, and lowest in 2015 during an extended marine heat wave, when 91% were located in British Columbia. Using hierarchical generalized additive models, we predicted greatest krill abundance in cooler waters (0.2°C below the time series average), within 10-20 km of the shelf break, and in bottom depths between 200 and 400 m. This newly developed coast-wide time series of krill abundance and distribution will inform ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts, and offers additional opportunities for studies of krill-dependent fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) originating from rivers throughout the west coast of North America support mixed-stock ocean fisheries and other ecosystem components, notably as prey for marine mammals. We construct the first coastwide state-space model for fall Chinook salmon tagged fish released from California to British Columbia between 1977 and 1990 to estimate seasonal ocean distribution along the west coast of North America. We incorporate recoveries from multiple ocean fisheries and allow for regional variation in fisheries vulnerability and maturation. We show that Chinook salmon ocean distribution depends strongly on region of origin and varies seasonally, while survival showed regionally varying temporal patterns. Simulations incorporating juvenile production data provide proportional stock composition in different ocean regions and the first coastwide projections of Chinook salmon aggregate abundance. Our model provides an extendable framework that can be applied to understand drivers of Chinook salmon biology (e.g., climate effects on ocean distribution) and management effects (e.g., consequences of juvenile production changes).},

abstract = {Objective: The study was designed to assess long-term variability in the distribution of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria. The study also evaluated whether Sablefish and Pacific salmon shared food resources and looked to characterize Sablefish during an understudied period of their life cycle. Methods: To meet the objectives, the study used data from 26 years of surface trawls conducted in Oregon and Washington coastal waters (1998–2023). Spatial–temporal models were used to measure changes in abundance and distribution of Pacific salmon and Sablefish along with covariates of ocean temperature. The study evaluated trophic characteristics of Pacific salmon and Sablefish from 2020 for differences. The temporal variation in size and diets of Sablefish were also analyzed, along with energy density of fish caught in 2020. Result: The spatial–temporal model demonstrated that there has been a nearshore expansion of juvenile Sablefish over the past 26 years that was correlated with increased ocean temperature. The nearshore expansion of Sablefish resulted in increased spatial and trophic overlap with juvenile Pacific salmon. While feeding in nearshore waters, juvenile Sablefish demonstrated competitive feeding advantages over juvenile Pacific salmon during a critical phase of salmonid early marine life history. Juvenile Sablefish exhibited significant ontogenetic diet and energetic shifts, and even the smallest (68–80 mm fork length) were piscivorous. Conclusions: If juvenile Sablefish numbers continue to increase relative to Pacific salmon, they could exert more competitive pressure, especially if food resources become limited. Pacific salmon may experience adverse effects from competition, regardless of whether or not juvenile Sablefish, which have recently expanded into nearshore waters, successfully recruit to the adult population.},

abstract = {Spatial, phenotypic and genetic diversity at relatively small scales can buffer species against large-scale processes such as climate change that tend to synchronize populations and increase temporal variability in overall abundance or production. This portfolio effect generally results in improved biological and economic outcomes for managed species. Previous evidence for the portfolio effect in salmonids has arisen from examinations of time series of adult abundance, but we lack evidence of spatial buffering of temporal variability in demographic rates such as survival of juveniles during their first year of life. We therefore use density-dependent population models with multiple random effects to represent synchronous (similar among populations) and asynchronous (different among populations) temporal variability as well as spatial variability in survival. These are fitted to 25 years of survey data for breeding adults and surviving juveniles from 15 demographically distinct populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within a single metapopulation in the Snake River in Idaho, USA. Model selection identifies the most support for the model that included both synchronous and asynchronous temporal variability, in addition to spatial variability. Asynchronous variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}55) is approximately equal in magnitude to synchronous temporal variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}67), but much lower than spatial variability (log-SD = 1{\textperiodcentered}11). We also show that the pairwise correlation coefficient, a common measure of population synchrony, is approximated by the estimated ratio of shared and total variance, where both approaches yield a synchrony estimate of 0{\textperiodcentered}59. We therefore find evidence for spatial buffering of temporal variability in early juvenile survival, although between-population variability that persists over time is also large. We conclude that spatial variation decreases interannual changes in overall juvenile production, which suggests that conservation and restoration of spatial diversity will improve population persistence for this metapopulation. However, the exact magnitude of spatial buffering depends upon demographic parameters such as adult survival that may vary among populations and is proposed as an area of future research using hierarchical life cycle models. We recommend that future sampling of this metapopulation employ a repeated-measure sampling design to improve estimation of early juvenile carrying capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {In the Northern California Current (NCC), zooplankton communities show interannual and multiyear shifts in species dominance that are tracked by survival of salmon populations. These zooplankton community changes correlate with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index: a 'warm-water' copepod species group is more abundant during warm (positive) phases of the PDO and less abundant during cold (negative) phases; the reverse occurs for a 'cold-water' species group. The observed relationship led to the hypothesis that the relative dominance of warm/cold-water copepods in the NCC is driven by changes in the horizontal advection of surface water over different phases of the PDO. To test this hypothesis, variation in surface water advection to coastal regions of the NCC over the period of 1950-2008 was investigated using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and passive tracer experiments, then was compared with zooplankton collected off Oregon since 1996. Results showed that surface water advection varied with the phase of the PDO; the low-frequency component of advection anomalies strongly correlated with copepod species composition (R>0.9). During positive phases of the PDO, current anomalies were northward and onshore, resulting in transport of warmer waters and the associated copepods into the region. During negatives phases, increased equatorward current anomalies led to a copepod community that was dominated by cold-water taxa. Our results support the hypothesis that climate-driven changes in basin-scale circulation controls copepod community composition in the NCC, and demonstrate that large-scale climate forcings downscale to influence local and regional ecosystem structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

abstract = {Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain >90% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. In general, models with year, day and day2 had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4-50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {The Northern California Current (NCC) is a seasonally productive and open ecosystem. It is home to both a diverse endemic community and to seasonally transient species. Productivity and food web structure vary seasonally, interannually, and decadally due to variability in coastal upwelling, climate-scale physical processes, and the migratory species entering the system. The composition of the pelagic community varies between years, including changes to mid-trophic level groups that represent alternate energy-transfer pathways between lower and upper trophic levels (forage fishes, euphausiids, jellyfish). Multiple data sets, including annual spring and summer mesoscale surveys of the zooplankton, pelagic fish, and seabird communities, were used to infer NCC trophic network arrangements and develop end-to-end models for each of the 2003-2007 upwelling seasons. Each model was used to quantify the interannual variability in energy-transfer efficiency from bottom to top trophic levels. When each model was driven under an identical nutrient input rate, substantial differences in the energy available to each functional group were evident. Scenario analyses were used to examine the roles of forage fishes, euphausiids, and jellyfish (small gelatinous zooplankton and large carnivorous jellyfish) as alternate energy transfer pathways. Euphausiids were the more important energy transfer pathway; a large proportion of the lower trophic production consumed was transferred to higher trophic levels. In contrast, jellyfish acted as a production loss pathway; little of the production consumed was passed upwards. Analysis of the range of ecosystem states observed interannually and understanding system sensitivity to variability among key trophic groups improves our ability to predict NCC ecosystem response to short- and long-term environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Variations in marine prey availability and nutritional quality can affect juvenile salmon growth and survival during early ocean residence. Salmon growth, and hence survival, may be related to the onset of piscivory, but there is limited knowledge on the interplay between the prey field, environment, and salmon ontogeny. Subyearling Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and their potential prey were sampled in coastal waters off Willapa Bay, USA to explore this issue. Three seasonal prey assemblages were identified, occurring in spring (May), early summer (June – July), and late summer (August – September). The onset of piscivory, based on salmon stomach contents, fatty acids, and stable isotopes occurred later in 2011 compared to 2012, and coincided with the appearance of Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Salmon fork length (FL) and carbon isotope values ($\delta$13C) increased with a fatty acid biomarker for marine phytoplankton and decreased with a freshwater marker, indicating dietary carbon sources changed as salmon emigrated from the Columbia River. Salmon FL also increased with nitrogen isotope ratios ($\delta$15N), trophic position, and a fatty acid marker for piscivory – a consequence of the ontogenetic shift in diet to fish. Salmon grew faster and obtained larger size and condition by September 2011 compared to 2012, which was related to inter-annual differences in ocean conditions and the duration over which Northern Anchovy were available. Our results support the idea that juvenile salmon growth depends on the onset and duration of piscivory, suggesting both of these factors may be important components of lifetime growth and fitness.},

abstract = {Background: Studies that attempt to measure shifts in species distributions often consider a single species in isolation. However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator–prey overlap metrics: Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator–prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study: We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator–prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions: Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator–prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

abstract = {Euphausia pacifica is an abundant and important prey resource for numerous predators of the California Current and elsewhere in the North Pacific. We developed an individual-based model (IBM) for E. pacifica to study its bioenergetics (growth, stage development, reproduction, and mortality) under constant/ideal conditions as well as under varying ocean conditions and food resources. To model E. pacifica under varying conditions, we coupled the IBM to an oceanographic-ecosystem model over the period 2000-2008 (9 years). Model results under constant/ideal food conditions compare favorably with experimental studies conducted under food unlimited conditions. Under more realistic variable oceanographic conditions, mean growth rates over the continental shelf were positive only when individuals migrated diurnally to the depth of maximum phytoplankton layer during nighttime feeding. Our model only used phytoplankton as prey and coastal growth rates were lower than expected (0.01 mmd-1), suggesting that a diverse prey base (zooplankton, protists, marine snow) may be required to facilitate growth and survival of modeled E. pacifica in the coastal environment. This coupled IBM-ROMS modeling framework and its parameters provides a tool for understanding the biology and ecology of E. pacifica and could be developed to further the understanding of climatic effects on this key prey species and enhance an ecosystem approach to fisheries and wildlife management in this region.},

abstract = {The vast spatial extent of the ocean presents a major challenge for monitoring changes in marine biodiversity and connecting those changes to management practices. Remote-sensing offers promise for overcoming this problem in a cost-effective, tractable way, but requires interdisciplinary expertise to identify robust approaches. In this study, we use generalized additive mixed models to evaluate the relationship between an epipelagic fish community in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and oceanographic predictor variables, quantified in situ as well as via remote-sensing. We demonstrate the utility of using MODIS Rrs555 fields at monthly and interannual timescales to better understand how freshwater input into the Northern California Current region affects higher trophic level biology. These relationships also allow us to identify a gradient in community composition characteristic of warmer, offshore areas and cooler, nearshore areas over the period 2003–2012, and predict community characteristics outside of sampled species data from 2013 to 2015. These spatial maps therefore represent a new, temporally and spatially explicit index of community differences, potentially useful for filling gaps in regional ecosystem status reports and is germane to the broader ecosystem-based fisheries management context.},

abstract = {Yearling Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were sampled concurrently with physical variables (temperature, salinity, depth) and biological variables (chlorophyll a concentration and copepod abundance) along the Washington and Oregon coast in June 1998-2008. Copepod species were divided into four different groups based on their water-type affinities: cold neritic, subarctic oceanic, warm neritic, and warm oceanic. Generalized linear mixed models were used to quantify the relationship between the abundance of these four different copepod groups and the abundance of juvenile salmon. The relationships between juvenile salmon and different copepod groups were further validated using regression analysis of annual mean juvenile salmon abundance versus the mean abundance of the copepod groups. Yearling Chinook salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with cold neritic copepods, subarctic copepods, and chlorophyll a concentration. The selected habitat variables explained 67% of the variation in yearling Chinook abundance. Yearling coho salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with temperature. The selected habitat variables explained 40% of the variation in yearling coho abundance. Results suggest that copepod communities can be used to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of abundance of juvenile salmon, i.e., large-scale interannual variations in ocean conditions (warm versus cold years) and inshore-offshore (cross-shelf) gradients in the abundance of juvenile salmon can be characterized by differences in the abundance of copepod species with various water mass affinities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In this review and prospectus, we summarize key findings from this program and describe a plan for transitioning it to better support Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM). While we focus on salmon research, our approach applies to research design generally. Our path forward involves increasing understanding of ecosystem processes to improve the dependability of scenario testing under novel conditions. Over the past two decades, we developed a conceptual model for how climate, predators, prey, fisheries, and human activities influence salmon. Knowledge gaps we identified from our conceptual model include limited understanding of salmon distributions, behavior, maturation dynamics, and population dynamics, and salmon interactions with predators, competitors, and prey during winter. We consider emerging risks and vulnerabilities facing salmon and propose analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Increased predator populations, coupled with climate change, pose increasing threats to West Coast salmon and will require new strategies and actions to mitigate their negative impacts. We propose research to support the development of decision-support tools to evaluate tradeoffs associated with alternative management strategies and to inform an adaptive ecosystem management system to improve the resilience of salmon populations and salmon-dependent fisheries.},

abstract = {Characterization of the diets of upper-trophic pelagic predators that consume forage species is a key ingredient in the development of ecosystem-based fishery management plans, conservation of marine predators, and ecological and economic modeling of trophic interactions. Here we present the California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) for the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean over the past century, assimilating over 190 published records of predator food habits for over 100 predator species and 32 categories of forage taxa (species or groups of similar species). Literature searches targeted all predators that consumed forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate. Diet data were compiled into a relational database. Analysis of the CCPDD highlighted differences in predator diet data availability based on geography, time period and predator taxonomy, as well as prominent prey categories. The top 5 forage taxa with the most predators included juvenile rockfish, northern anchovy, euphausiid krill, Pacific herring and market squid. Predator species with abundant data included Pacific hake, common murre, and California sea lion. Most diet data were collected during the summer; the lack of winter data will restrict future use of the CCPDD to understand seasonal patterns in predator diet unless more such data become available. Increased synthesis of historical information can provide new resources to understand patterns in the role of forage species in predator diet. Increased publication and/or accessibility of long-term datasets and data-sharing will further foster the synthesis of information intended to inform the management, conservation and understanding of marine food webs.},

abstract = {1. Geostatistical data-spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon-are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate. 2. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE-(stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software. 3. We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization). 4. We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

Yet little is known about the spatial and temporal distributions of these ESUs immediately following ocean entry, when year-class success may be determined. We documented differences in dispersal patterns during the early ocean period among groups defined by ESU, adult run timing, and smolt age. Between 1995 and 2006, 1,896 coded-wire-tagged juvenile fish from the Columbia River basin were recovered during 6,142 research trawl events along the West Coast of North America. Three distinct ocean dispersal patterns were observed: (1) age-1 (yearling) mid and upper Columbia River spring-run and Snake River spring-summer-run Chinook Salmon migrated rapidly northward and by late summer were not found south of Vancouver Island; (2) age-0 (subyearling) lower Columbia River fall, upper Columbia River summer, upper Columbia River fall, and Snake River fall Chinook Salmon dispersed slowly, remaining mainly south of Vancouver Island through autumn; and (3) age-1 lower Columbia River spring, upper Columbia River summer, and upper Willamette River spring Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon were widespread along the coast from summer through fall, indicating a diversity of dispersal rates. Generally, the ocean dispersal of age-1 fish was faster and more extensive than that of age-0 fish, with some age-1 fish migrating as fast as 10-40 km/d (0.5-3.0 body lengths/s). Within groups, interannual variation in dispersal was moderate. Identification of the distinct temporal and spatial ocean distribution patterns of juvenile salmon from Columbia River basin ESUs is important in order to evaluate the potential influence of changing ocean conditions on the survival and long term sustainability of these fish populations.

abstract = {Selection of prey that are small and in poor body condition is a widespread phenomenon in terrestrial predator-prey systems and may benefit prey populations by removing substandard individuals. Similar selection is widely assumed to operate in aquatic systems. Indeed, size-selective predation is a longstanding and central tenet of aquatic food web theory. However, it is not known if aquatic predators select prey based on their condition or state, compared to their size. Surprisingly, no comparable information is available for marine systems because it is exceedingly difficult to make direct observations in this realm. Thus the role of body condition in regulating susceptibility to predation remains a black box in the marine environment. Here we have exploited an ideal model system to evaluate selective predation on pelagic marine fish: comparing characteristics (fork length, mass corrected for fork length) of fresh, whole, intact juvenile Pacific salmon delivered by a seabird to its single nestling with salmon collected concurrently in coastal trawl surveys. Three species of juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are consumed by provisioning Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata); an abundant, colonial, pursuitdiving seabird. Samples were collected from multiple colonies and fisheries surveys in coastal British Columbia in two years. As predicted, Auklets preyed on small individuals in poor condition and consistently selected them at levels higher than their relative availability. This is the first study to provide direct evidence for both size- and condition-selective predation on marine fish in the wild. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point in evaluating how selective predation may structure or influence marine fish populations and bridges a fundamental incongruity between ecological theory and application; although "bigger is better" is considered a fundamental tenet of marine food webs, marine predators are often assumed to consume indiscriminately.},

abstract = {Tracking of marine animals has increased exponentially in the past decade, and the resulting data could lead to an in-depth understanding of the causes and consequences of movement in the ocean. However, most common marine tracking systems are associated with large measurement errors. Accounting for these errors requires the use of hierarchical models, which are often difficult to fit to data. Using 3 case studies, we demonstrate that Template Model Builder (TMB), a new R package, is an accurate, efficient and flexible framework for modelling movement data. First, to demonstrate that TMB is as accurate but 30 times faster than bsam, a popular R package used to apply state-space models to Argos data, we modelled polar bear Ursus maritimus Argos data and compared the locations estimated by the models to GPS locations of these same bears. Second, to demonstrate how TMBs gain in efficiency and frequentist framework facilitate model comparison, we developed models with different error structures and compared them to find the most effective model for light-based geolocations of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata. Finally, to maximize efficiency through TMBs use of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood, we modelled behavioural changes with continuous rather than discrete states. This new model directly accounts for the irregular sampling intervals characteristic of Fastloc-GPS data of grey seals Halichoerus grypus. Using real and simulated data, we show that TMB is a fast and powerful tool for modelling marine movement data. We discuss how TMBs potential reaches beyond marine movement studies.},

Here, we used otolith microstructure and chemistry to examine the factors potentially linked to selective mortality of juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from California's Central Valley during early ocean residence. Back-calculated size and growth rates of the population were compared across 3 sample periods: as juveniles exited the San Francisco Bay estuary (estuary-exit), after their first month at sea (summer-ocean) and 5 mo after ocean entry (fall-ocean). We compared mortality dynamics during years of exceptional recruitment (addition of individuals to harvestable population; 2000 and 2001) to a year of poor recruitment (2005). Otoliths from 2005 were also analyzed for sulfur isotopes to discern hatchery from naturally spawned stock. Significant size and growth-rate selective mortality were detected during the first month at sea in the low recruitment year of 2005, but not in 2000 and 2001. Individuals that were larger and growing faster during freshwater and estuarine rearing were more likely to survive to summer and fall in the low recruitment year. There was a slight, but insignificant, increase in the proportion of hatchery to naturally spawned individuals from estuary-exit to fall-ocean, suggesting that fish from neither origin were overwhelmingly favored. Our results suggest that Central Valley Chinook salmon can be subject to significant size and growth-rate selective mortality resulting in low adult abundance, and this mortality appears independent of origin. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

Here, we show that the physical and ecological conditions mapping onto the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index have changed over multidecadal timescales. These changes apparently began around a 1988/1989 North Pacific climate shift that was marked by abrupt northeast Pacific warming, declining temporal variance in the Aleutian Low (a leading atmospheric driver of the PDO), and increasing correlation between the PDO and NPGO patterns. Sea level pressure and surface temperature patterns associated with each climate index changed after 1988/1989, indicating that identical index values reflect different states of basin-scale climate over time. The PDO and NPGO also show time-dependent skill as indices of regional northeast Pacific ecosystem variability. Since the late 1980s, both indices have become less relevant to physical-ecological variability in regional ecosystems from the Bering Sea to the southern California Current. Users of these climate indices should be aware of nonstationary relationships with underlying climate variability within the historical record, and the potential for further nonstationarity with ongoing climate change.},

It has become more common to use stable isotopes to supplement traditional diet studies of salmon in the ocean; however, there have been no integrated syntheses of these data to determine whether stable isotope analyses support the existing conventional wisdom of feeding strategies of the Pacific salmon. We performed a meta-analysis of stable isotope data to examine the extent of trophic partitioning among five species of Pacific salmon during their marine lives. Pink, sockeye, and chum salmon showed very high overlap in resource use and there was no consistent evidence for chum relying on alternative food webs dominated by gelatinous zooplankton. $\delta$15N showed that Chinook and coho salmon fed at trophic levels higher than the other three species. In addition, these two species were distinctly enriched in 13C, suggesting more extensive use of coastal food webs compared to the more depleted (pelagic) signatures of pink, sockeye, and chum salmon. This paper presents the first synthesis of stable isotope work on Pacific salmon and provides $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values applicable to research on the fate of the marine derived nutrients these organisms transport to freshwater and riparian ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Forage fish play a central role in the transfer of energy from lower to higher trophic levels. Ocean conditions may influence this energy pathway in the Northern California Current (NCC) ecosystem, and we may expect it to differ between warm and cold periods in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The recent unprecedented warming in the NCC provides a unique opportunity to better understand the connection between ocean conditions and forage fish feeding habits and the potential consequences for predators that depend on them for sustenance. Here we present findings from gut content analysis to examine food sources of multiple forage fishes (northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax, jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus, Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus, and whitebait smelt Allosmerus elongatus) off the Washington and Oregon coasts. Analyses were applied to fish collected in May and June during recent warm years (2015 and 2016) and compared to previous collections made during cool (2011, 2012) and average (2000, 2002) years. Results of the diet analysis indicate that fish feeding habits varied significantly between cold and both average and warm periods. Euphausiids, decapods, and copepods were the main prey items of the forage fishes for most years examined; however, gelatinous zooplankton were consumed in much higher quantities in warm years compared to cold years. This shift in prey availability was also seen in plankton and trawl surveys in recent years and suggests that changing ocean conditions are likely to affect the type and quality of prey available to forage fish. Although gelatinous zooplankton are generally not believed to be suitable prey for most fishes due to their low energy content, some forage fishes may utilize this prey in the absence of more preferred prey resources during anomalously warm ocean conditions.},

Here, we test the importance of match-mismatch dynamics in the timing of salmon arrival to the ocean, relative to ecosystem phenology, for the ocean survival rates of hatchery-origin fall run Chinook salmon originating from California's Central Valley. Specifically, we considered tag recovery data for releases of coded-wire tagged fish released into the San Francisco Estuary during the years 1978 to 2010. We determined a time lag for each release relative to the local spring transition date (initiation of net upwelling). Additionally, we obtained information on fish condition and size at release, the number of fish released corresponding to distinct tag codes, and yearly stock-specific harvest rate estimates. We used generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and cross-validation to identify the best-supported models for the effects of release timing and other covariates on age-3 ocean fishery recovery rates, a proxy of ocean survival rates. Release time is a useful predictor of within-year variation in survival rates, above and beyond the effects of size at release, presence of disease, and the use of net pens, and the lag relative to spring transition was a slightly better predictor than year-day. The optimal release timing appeared to occur around the end of May, and the optimal time lag appeared to be approximately 70 to 115 d after the spring transition date. However, timing is only one of many factors that affected within- and among-year variation in survival.},

abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) spend much of their life near the ocean surface where climatic and oceanographic conditions affect their habitat and survival. Despite decades of study, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding their ecology and distributions. Consequently, it has been difficult to assess how environmental conditions influence the high-seas distribution and habitat use of these culturally and socioeconomically important fishes, presenting challenges to fisheries managers trying to evaluate how climate change and fishing activities may impact salmon populations. We used a recently compiled, comprehensive database of historical coastal and high-seas salmon survey data (1953–2022) in the North Pacific to fit species distribution models that (1) characterize the marine spatial distribution of six species of Oncorhynchus, (2) evaluate species-specific temperature preferences, and (3) investigate how species' temperature preferences influence distribution. Sea surface temperature, along with seasonal migrations associated with spawning and feeding, significantly affects the distribution of all species, where the warm limits of estimated preferred thermal ranges were more similar than the cold limits. Furthermore, the distributions of some species appear more responsive to temperature than others and recently observed warm conditions have likely impacted realized ranges. These models have expanded our understanding of salmon ocean distributions and thermal niches by providing a unique window into this often unobserved but important part of the life cycle. They also serve as a baseline for future investigations into the mechanisms influencing salmon spatial ecology, responses to climate change, and vulnerability to harvest across the North Pacific.},

abstract = {Ecology is often governed by nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear ecological relationships can include thresholds—incremental changes in drivers that provoke disproportionately large ecological responses. Among the species that experience nonlinear and threshold dynamics are Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). These culturally, ecologically, and economically significant fishes are in many places declining and management focal points. Often, managers can influence or react to ecological conditions that salmon experience, suggesting that nonlinearities, especially thresholds, may provide opportunities to inform decisions. However, nonlinear dynamics are not always invoked in management decisions involving salmon. Here, we review reported nonlinearities and thresholds in salmon ecology, describe potential applications that scientists and managers could develop to leverage nonlinear dynamics, and offer a path toward decisions that account for ecological nonlinearities and thresholds to improve salmon outcomes. It appears that nonlinear dynamics are not uncommon in salmon ecology and that many management arenas may potentially leverage them to enable more effective or efficient decisions. Indeed, decisions guided by nonlinearities and thresholds may be particularly desirable considering salmon management arenas are often characterized by limited resources and mounting ecological stressors, practical constraints, and conservation challenges. More broadly, many salmon systems are data-rich and there are an extensive range of ecological contexts in which salmon are sensitive to anthropogenic decisions. Approaches developed to leverage nonlinearities in salmon ecology may serve as examples that may inform analogous approaches in other systems and taxa.},

abstract = {A key process affecting variation in the recruitment of fish into fisheries is the spatio-temporal overlap between prey and predator (match−mismatch hypothesis, MMH). The Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua and its dominant prey, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, have long been studied in the Norwegian−Barents Sea system. However, the mechanistic explanation of how cod survival is affected by MMH dynamics remains unclear. Most MMH studies have focused on either the time synchrony or the spatial overlap between trophic levels. Here, we used G. morhua larvae and C. finmarchicus data collected in the Norwegian−Barents Sea via ichthyoplankton surveys from 1959−1992 to assess the effect of the predator−prey relationship on predator recruitment to the fisheries at age 3 (as a measure of survival) and to develop a metric of predator−prey overlap using spatio-temporal statistical models. We then compared the interannual variability of the predator–prey overlap with the predator's abundance at recruitment to assess how MMH dynamics explain the survival of cod during its early life stages. We found that the amount of overlap between cod larvae (length: 11−15 mm) and their prey explained 29% of cod recruitment variability. Positive correlations between predator−prey overlap and subsequent recruitment were also found for predators of 6−10 and 16−20 mm, but not for 21+ mm. This improved predator−prey overlap metric is thus (1) useful to better understand how predator−prey dynamics at early life stages of fish impact the survival of later stages; and (2) a valuable tool for assessing the state of an ecosystem.},

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of diets by size showed several distinct groupings as the salmon grew during their first marine summer. These size‐based diet differences were clearly driven by increased rates of piscivory for both species. Fish prey composition, feeding intensity, and fish prey–predator length ratios all significantly increased for coho salmon at approximately 240 mm fork length when they changed from diets dominated by juvenile rockfishes Sebastes spp., the larvae of crabs Cancer spp., and adult euphausiids to one of predominantly juvenile forage fish. As Chinook salmon grew, they gradually increased the proportional contribution (by weight) of fish prey in their diets—from 55% in the smallest length‐class examined (80–100 mm) to 95% in the largest one (>375 mm). Chinook salmon fed in the same marine environments as coho salmon and consistently ate more and longer fish prey at a given size than coho salmon but had lower overall feeding intensity, perhaps owing to a higher level of prey selection. Relating subsequent interannual adult salmon returns to juvenile diets showed mixed results. During lower‐survival years, coho salmon ate fewer and smaller fish prey, while subyearling Chinook salmon had less total food and more empty stomachs. We did not find consistent trophic patterns for yearling Chinook salmon in relation to their ultimate survival. },

Studies of anadromous species often focus on freshwater despite the ocean's disproportionate influence on survival and growth. To understand a prominent anadromous species' response to ocean climate, we use a new spatio-temporal model jointly estimating the ocean distribution of all major fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salmonidae) stocks from California to British Columbia over 40 years. We model hundreds of millions of tagged individuals, finding that different stocks have fundamentally different ocean distributions, distinct associations with sea surface temperature (SST), and contrasting distributional responses to historical ocean SST variation. We show species-level estimates of ocean distribution that ignore among-stock variation will lead to errant predictions of spatial distribution. Using future (2030–2090) SST projections to model focal stocks of fisheries importance we predict substantial ocean redistribution in response to SST change. Predicted aggregate distributional changes do not follow a simple, poleward shift. Instead, we predict net movement into some ocean regions (British Columbia, central California) but net movement out of others (northern California, Washington). Distribution shifts have implications for both major fisheries and marine mammal predators of Chinook salmon. We focus on the consequences of spatial changes in ocean distribution, but our approach provides a general structure to link marine and freshwater components of anadromous species under climate change.},

Cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and capelin Mallotus villosus are 3 key species that overlap in a large portion of the NBS ecosystem. In this hypothesis-driven study, we investigated the interaction of these 3 species during their pelagic larval stage and assessed the impact of their spatio-temporal overlap on survival. We hypothesised that the spatio-temporal overlap between the larvae of the 3 species, as they likely drift together, influences their survival at later stages. We calculated the spatio-temporal overlap of each pair of the 3 studied species and tested it against their recruitment. We utilised a multiple linear regression model with temperature, spawning stock biomass, and spatio-temporal overlap among larvae, their food, and competitors as explanatory variables; this model explained $\sim$43, $\sim$24, and $\sim$73% of the variability in cod, haddock, and capelin recruitment, respectively. The overlaps between larval cod and competing species and/or food have a negative influence on cod recruitment, whereas the sign of the relationships pertaining to haddock and capelin varies.

Pacific salmon abundance has been highly variable over the last few decades and most forecasting models have proven inadequate, primarily because of a lack of understanding of the processes affecting variability in survival. Better methods and data for predicting the abundance of returning adults are therefore required to effectively manage the species. We combined 31 distinct indicators of the marine environment collected over an 11-year period into a multivariate analysis to summarize and predict adult spring Chinook salmon returns to the Columbia River in 2012. In addition to forecasts, this tool quantifies the strength of the relationship between various ecological indicators and salmon returns, allowing interpretation of ecosystem processes. The relative importance of indicators varied, but a few trends emerged. Adult returns of spring Chinook salmon were best described using indicators of bottom-up ecological processes such as composition and abundance of zooplankton and fish prey as well as measures of individual fish, such as growth and condition. Local indicators of temperature or coastal upwelling did not contribute as much as large-scale indicators of temperature variability, matching the spatial scale over which salmon spend the majority of their ocean residence. Results suggest that effective management of Pacific salmon requires multiple types of data and that no single indicator can represent the complex early-ocean ecology of salmon.},

abstract = {Forage fishes are ecologically and economically important in marine ecosystems worldwide and thus are a focal topic for ecosystem-based fisheries management. In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), the community dynamics of forage populations have been studied at regional spatial scales, but not across regions. To evaluate indicators of the forage community at the ecosystem-wide scale, we examine temporal variability of forage assemblages in Northern (Oregon/Washington), Central (California; Point Reyes to Monterey Bay) and Southern (southern California) regions of the CCLME from 1998 through 2016 which include years with unprecedented climate variability. Forage communities fluctuated greatly between years within each region owing to regionally low abundances of common taxa in at least some years (e.g., rockfishes Sebastes spp. in each region). Comparison of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Ni{\~{n}}o to La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013–2014. Changes in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context on spatio-temporal changes in the structure of forage fish communities important to top predators in this system.},

For migrating species, such as salmonids that move through multiple habitats, these correlations can amplify the impact of good or poor physical conditions on growth and survival, as movements among habitats may not alleviate effects of anomalous conditions. Unfortunately, identifying the mechanistic drivers of salmon survival in space and time is hindered by these cross-habitat correlations. To address this issue, we modeled the marine survival of Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon with multiple indices of the marine environment and an explicit treatment of the effect of arrival timing from freshwater to the ocean, and found that both habitats contribute to marine survival rates. We show how this particular carryover effect of freshwater conditions on marine survival varies by year and rearing type (hatchery or wild), with a larger effect for wild fish. As environmental conditions change, incorporating effects from both freshwater and marine habitats into salmon survival models will become more important, and has the additional benefit of highlighting how management actions that affect arrival timing may improve marine survival.},

abstract = {Dramatic changes in the physical and biological conditions off Washington and Oregon, USA, have occurred since 1998, including extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o (warm) and La Ni{\~{n}}a (cool) years, high and low Columbia River flow years, a major intrusion of subarctic water, and a low oxygen event on the shelf. The occurrence of contrasting environmental conditions provided an excellent opportunity to examine pelagic nekton distributions and their abiotic and biotic associations. Pelagic surface trawl surveys conducted during June and September from 1998 to 2002 off northern Washington to central Oregon revealed a nekton community dominated by Pacific herring (33.5% of total catch), Pacific sardines (29.9%), and northern anchovy (12.3%). Between 1998 and 2002, species composition shifted from a community dominated by southern species (mackerels and hake) to one dominated by northern species (squid, smelts, and salmon), but the transition was gradual, and small pelagic species (sardines, herring, and anchovy) showed no consistent trends in abundance over time. Species diversity/evenness was highest in September 2002. Cluster analysis identified 7 species and 6 station clusters. Subyearling Chinook salmon, market squid, Pacific sardine, yearling coho salmon, and Pacific saury were the strongest indicator species for 5 of these cluster groups. Cluster group distributions differed between both inshore/offshore and north/south. A 3-dimensional ordination explained 55% of the total variance with bottom depth, distance from shore, and sea-surface temperature correlated with the first axis, latitude with the second axis, and surface salinity, surface density and stability with the third axis. Our results suggest that the habitats occupied by pelagic nekton species expand and contract in relation to the dynamic nature of the California Current and are affected by changing ocean conditions at both seasonal and interannual periodicities. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

We examined length, mass, and condition index of age-0 juveniles collected in the ocean during June and September across 11 years in relation to conditions in the river, estuary, and coastal ocean and to future adult returns. Characteristics of juveniles in September, but not June, were related to adult returns. During years when coastal waters were relatively cool and productive, juveniles captured in September displayed relatively low condition and reduced otolith growth compared with years when coastal waters were relatively warm and unproductive; this contrast indicates that top-down effects such as selective mortality or competition are important during early marine residence. Key physical (river plume volume during emigration) and biological (condition) variables and their interaction accounted for >95% of the variation in adult returns. Future research should focus on evaluating predators and competitors and understanding how river plume structure influences survival.},

abstract = {Sustainable fishery practices require accurate predictions of fish recruitment - the abundance of a new year class entering a fishery. A key driver of recruitment is the impact predator-prey dynamics experienced during early life stages has on their survival at later stages, as in the Match-Mismatch Hypothesis (MMH). MMH states that predator survival depends on the match (or mismatch) between the timing of predator feeding and that of prey availability. This study aims to understand how predator-prey spatio-temporal overlap explains the variation in a pelagic fish population. We explore the predator-prey overlap between each pair of three trophic levels in the North Sea (NS) from 1982-2017: herring (Clupea harengus) larvae, zooplankton (Temora longicornis, Oithona sp.,Pseudocalanus spp., and Acartia spp.), and a phytoplankton index. We found that MMH explained 23% of recruitment (1-year-old) of NS autumn-spawning (NSAS) herring, performed similarly (21-26%) when using different trophic levels, and that there was a spatial pattern in both the overlap and the negative relationship between the overlap and recruitment, similar to the variation of habitat use of NS herring. Our results characterize how the MMH, including spatial variability, plays in controlling herring recruitment, while also considering unexplained variation for future study.},

abstract = {Climate change is rapidly affecting the seasonal timing of spatial demographic processes. Consequently, resource managers require information from models that simultaneously measure seasonal, interannual, and spatial variation. We present a spatio-temporal model that includes annual, seasonal, and spatial variation in density and then highlight two important uses: (i) standardizing data that are spatially unbalanced within multiple seasons and (ii) identifying interannual changes in seasonal timing (phenology) of population processes. We demonstrate these uses with two contrasting case studies: three bottom trawl surveys for yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean from 1985 to 2017 and pelagic tows for copepodite stage 3þ copepod (Calanus glacialis/marshallae) densities in the eastern Bering Sea from 1993 to 2016. The yellowtail analysis illustrates how data from multiple surveys can be used to infer density hot spots in an area that is not sampled one or more surveys. The copepod analysis assimilates seasonally unbalanced samples to estimate an annual index of the seasonal timing of copepod abundance and identifies a positive correlation between this index and cold-pool extent. We conclude by discussing additional potential uses of seasonal spatio-temporal models and emphasize their ability to identify climate-driven shifts in the seasonal timing of fish movement and ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Research on regulatory mechanisms in biological populations often focuses on environmental covariates. An integrated approach that combines environmental indices with organismal-level information can provide additional insight on regulatory mechanisms. Survival of spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is consistently low whereas some adjacent populations with similar life histories experience greater survival. It is not known if populations with differential survival respond similarly during early marine residence, a critical period in the life history. Ocean collections, genetic stock identification, and otolith analyses were combined to evaluate the growth-mortality and matchmismatch hypotheses during early marine residence of spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon. Interannual variation in juvenile attributes, including size at marine entry and marine growth rate, was compared with estimates of survival and physical and biological metrics. Multiple linear regression and multi-model inference were used to evaluate the relative importance of biological and physical metrics in explaining interannual variation in survival. There was relatively weak support for the match-mismatch hypothesis and stronger evidence for the growth-mortality hypothesis. Marine growth and size at capture were strongly, positively related to survival, a finding similar to spring Chinook salmon from the Mid-Upper Columbia River. In hindcast models, basin-scale indices (Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)) and biological indices (juvenile salmon catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and a copepod community index (CCI)) accounted for substantial and similar portions of variation in survival for juvenile emigration years 1998-2008 (R2> 0.70). However, in forecast models for emigration years 2009-2011, there was an increasing discrepancy between predictions based on the PDO (50-448% of observed value) compared with those based on the NPGO (68-212%) or biological indices (CPUE and CCI: 83-172%). Overall, the PDO index was remarkably informative in earlier years but other basin-scale and biological indices provided more accurate indications of survival in recent years. {\textcopyright} 2014 Miller et al.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the global impact of microplanktonic grazers on marine phytoplankton and its implications for remineralization processes in the microbial community. The data were obtained by an extensive literature search that yielded 788 paired rate estimates of autotrophic growth ($\mu$) and microzooplankton grazing (m) from dilution experiments. From studies in which phytoplankton standing stock was measured in terms of carbon equivalents, we show that the production estimate from dilution experiments is a reasonable proxy (r = 0.89) for production determined by the standard 14C method. The ratio m:$\mu$, the proportion of primary production (PP) consumed by micrograzers, shows that microzooplankton consumption is the main source of phytoplankton mortality in the oceans, accounting for 67% of phytoplankton daily growth for the full data set. This ratio varies modestly among various marine habitats and regions, with data averages ranging from 60% for coastal and estuarine environments to 70% for the open oceans, and from ∼59% for temperate-subpolar and polar systems to 75% for tropical-subtropical regions. Given estimates for the metabolic requirements of micrograzers and assuming they consume most bacterial production, regionally averaged estimates of the protistan respiration are 35-43% of daily PP for the first level of consumer or 49-59% of PP for three trophic transfers. The estimated contributions of microbial grazers to total community respiration are of the same magnitude as bacterial respiration. Consequently, potential ecosystem differences in micrograzer activity or trophic structure are a large uncertainty for biogeochemical models that seek to predict the microbial community role in carbon cycling from bacterial parameters alone.},

We used data from coded wire tag release groups of hatchery Chinook salmon to test whether hatchery release date, release size, and size in offshore waters in July and September influenced marine survival. Marine survival was most strongly related to the average body size in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. This relationship was consistent over multiple years (1997-2002), suggesting that mortality after July is strongly size-dependent. Release size and date only slightly improved this relationship, whereas size in September showed little relationship to marine survival. Specifically, fish that experienced the highest marine survivals were released before 25 May and were larger than 17 g (or 120 mm fork length) by July. Our findings highlight the importance of local conditions in Puget Sound (Washington, USA) during the spring and summer, and suggest that declines in marine survival since the 1980s may have been caused by reductions in the quality of feeding and growing conditions during early marine life.},

abstract = {Captive rearing and translocation are often used concurrently for species conservation, yet the effects of these practices can interact and lead to unintended outcomes that may undermine species' recovery efforts. Controls in translocation or artificial-propagation programs are uncommon; thus, there have been few studies on the interacting effects of these actions and environmental conditions on survival. The Columbia River basin, which drains 668,000 km2 of the western United States and Canada, has an extensive network of hydroelectric and other dams, which impede and slow migration of anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and can increase mortality rates. To mitigate for hydrosystem-induced mortality during juvenile downriver migration, tens of millions of hatchery fish are released each year and a subset of wild- and hatchery-origin juveniles are translocated downstream beyond the hydropower system. We considered how the results of these practices interact with marine environmental conditions to affect the marine survival of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha). We analyzed data from more than 1 million individually tagged fish from 1998 through 2006 to evaluate the probability of an individual fish returning as an adult relative to its rearing (hatchery vs. wild) and translocation histories (translocated vs. in-river migrating fish that traveled downriver through the hydropower system) and a suite of environmental variables. Except during select periods of very low river flow, marine survival of wild translocated fish was approximately two-thirds less than survival of wild in-river migrating fish. For hatchery fish, however, survival was roughly two times higher for translocated fish than for in-river migrants. Competition and predator aggregation negatively affected marine survival, and the magnitude of survival depended on rearing and translocation histories and biological and physical conditions encountered during their first few weeks of residence in the ocean. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interacting effects of translocation, artificial propagation, and environmental variables on the long-term viability of species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Phenological shifts and subsequent mismatches may be consistent across populations, or they could vary unpredictably across populations within the same species. For anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), juveniles from thousands of locally adapted populations migrate from diverse freshwater habitats to the Pacific Ocean every year. Both the timing of freshwater migration and ocean arrival, relative to nearshore prey (phenological match/mismatch), can control marine survival and population dynamics. Here we examined phenological change of 66 populations across six anadromous Pacific salmon species throughout their range in western North America with the longest time series spanning 1951–2019. We show that different salmon species have different rates of phenological change but that there was substantial within-species variation that was not correlated with changing environmental conditions or geographic patterns. Moreover, outmigration phenologies have not tracked shifts in the timing of marine primary productivity, potentially increasing the frequency of future phenological mismatches. Understanding population responses to mismatches with prey are an important part of characterizing overall population-specific climate vulnerability.},

Juveniles were collected in trawl surveys conducted during spring, summer, and autumn over 15 years. Distributions (mean latitude and distance from shore) differed between  yearling and subyearling life history types and between stocks; many of these differences were consistent across years. Yearlings were nearly all (98%) from Columbia River sources, and only 6% were naturally produced. In late May, yearlings from the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers were farther north than other yearlings, likely due to the early spring timing of their releases from hatcheries and subsequent out-migration from the Columbia River However, yearling distributions in late June reflected known migration behaviors. Yearlings from interior Columbia and Snake River sources were farthest north by June, whereas yearlings from other stocks were more spread out in latitude. Subyearlings sampled in early summer were also largely from the Columbia River (98%), but greater percentages of subyearlings from coastal rivers were present during the fall (24%). In contrast to  yearlings, natural production accounted for nearly one-third of subyearlings. Subyearlings of most stocks tended toremain relatively near their point of sea entry throughout the summer. Subyearlings from the Snake River fall-run stock and upper Columbia River summer-fall-run stock exhibited diverse distributions that included both southward and northward dispersal.

abstract = {Trophic interactions are proximate drivers of ecosystem function, including predator− prey dynamics, and their spatio-temporal variability may reflect ecosystem shifts and changes in trophic transfer. We investigated biogeographic structuring of trophic interactions by analyzing multi-decadal time series of diet for Pacific hake Merluccius productus and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from a large marine ecosystem. We compared our predictions for spatio-temporal variability of hake and salmon trophoscapes (i.e. spatially explicit predictions of trophic relationships) to inform ecosystem dynamics and fishery bycatch patterns. We have 3 inter-related findings pertaining to the spatial coherence of the trophoscapes and the potential consequences to juvenile and sub-adult (i.e. after the first year at sea but prior to maturation) salmon when sharing foraging areas with Pacific hake. First, the spatial scale of Pacific hake diet represents coastwide variability, and the spatial variability of Chinook salmon diets differs across regions and demonstrates a broad diet. Second, the expectation for increased diet and spatial overlap of Pacific hake and Chinook salmon during low productivity periods (e.g. periods with low krill biomass, suboptimal upwelling) can inform fishery management challenges. In this regard, we explore the role of shared foraging habitats on increased predation, and consequentially reduced recruitment, by Pacific hake on juvenile salmon during sub-optimal upwelling conditions. Third, we show that above-average bycatch of sub-adult Chinook salmon was associated with later spring transition, potentially as a result of both Pacific hake and salmon sharing foraging areas and prey species on the shelf and shelf break.},

Little empirically based evidence exists to suggest that there is any one form of trophic control of EBC systems and, because of logistical constraints, knowledge of food web structure is limited in these large marine ecosystems. To determine principal trophic links within the pelagic food web, we combined stable isotope and diet analysis of 21 dominant species of nekton found within the northern California Current, a highly productive EBC upwelling ecosystem. Samples of nekton and zooplankton were collected in June and August 2000 and 2002 from the shelf-slope waters of northern California to Washington. Results showed most nekton consumed mixed diets of zooplankton and larval-juvenile or adult fishes, indicating the importance of omnivory in this system. Euphausiids were overwhelmingly the most prevalent zooplankton taxa in the diets of nekton across multiple trophic levels, accounting for >50% of the index of relative importance in 10 of 21 nekton species analyzed. Nitrogen stable isotopes ($\delta$15N) reflected trophic patterns observed in the diets, with most nekton species (∼62%) falling between trophic levels (TL) of full zooplanktivores (TL = 3) and full piscivores (TL = 4). The prevalence of omnivory observed here is probably due to high primary production that supports an abundance of large zooplankton prey, such as euphausiids, which may be a more available prey resource for a broad range of predators. A modification of this form of bottom-up control, termed bottom-up omnivory, is presented. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {Early ocean residence is considered a critical period for juvenile salmon although specific survival mechanisms are often unidentified and may vary by species or life stage. Columbia River spring-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha abundance has declined dramatically since the early 1900s. To elucidate mechanisms of early marine survival, we tested the 'bigger-is-better' and 'stage-duration' aspects of the 'growth-mortality' hypothesis, which posits that size and growth rate are important for future abundance. We tested the 'match-mismatch' hypothesis to determine whether early marine growth was related to indices related to regional productivity, including spring transition timing and copepod community composition. We generated estimates of individual size at ocean entry and capture, marine growth rate, early marine migration rate, and emigration timing using data from ocean surveys, genetic stock-assignment, and otolith analyses of juveniles collected across 8 yr between 1998 and 2008. Size at capture and marine growth rate after $\sim$30 d marine residence were positively related to future adult returns, whereas size at marine entry was not. Growth rate was not significantly related to indices of secondary production, but size at capture was significantly greater when lipid-rich copepods dominated. Although future adult abundance was not related to emigration timing, juveniles migrated more slowly when copepod biomass was high, perhaps responding to foraging conditions. Overall, processes during early ocean residence appear to be more important for cohort size establishment than those at marine entry. Approaches that combine genetic and otolith analyses have great potential to provide information on stock-specific variation in survival mechanisms. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

Methods: The relative abundance and spatial distribution of seabird predators and juvenile Chinook Salmon were quantified as part of long-term ecosystem surveys during May 2003–2012 and June 2003–2022. Genetic stock identification methods were used to assign individual fish to their respective stock groups. Stock-specific species distribution models then generated maps and indices of average annual spatial overlap between predators and prey within the survey area. Result: There is unequivocal evidence for spatial overlap between common murres, sooty shearwaters, and five genetic groups of interior and lower Columbia River juvenile Chinook Salmon. We found strongly positive (≥0.70) spatial correlations between predator and prey densities in both May and June, although spatial overlap was, in general, greater during May. The region of highest spatial overlap occurred on the inner continental shelf between the Columbia River mouth (46.2°N) and Grays Harbor (47.0°N), a region at the beginning of the juvenile salmon migratory pathway that is strongly affected by freshwater outflow from the river. Conclusion: Our findings support the idea that ocean avian predation during early marine residence has the potential to affect marine survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon and should be further investigated to better inform and implement ecological models and possible recovery actions for Chinook Salmon populations of the Columbia River basin.},

In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50°N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15-25°N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5°N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climatic changes are disrupting otherwise tight trophic interactions between predator and prey. Most of the earlier studies have primarily focused on the temporal dimension of the relationship in the framework of the match-mismatch hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that predator's recruitment will be high if the peak of the prey availability temporally matches the most energy-demanding period of the predators breeding phenology. However, the match-mismatch hypothesis ignores the level of food abundance while this can compensate small mismatches. Using a novel time-series model explicitly quantifying both the timing and the abundance component for trophic relationships, we here show that timing and abundance of food affect recruitment differently in a marine (cod/zooplankton), a marine-terrestrial (puffin/herring) and a terrestrial (sheep/vegetation) ecosystem. The quantification of the combined effect of abundance and timing of prey on predator dynamics enables us to come closer to the mechanisms by which environment variability may affect ecological systems. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Climate influences a population through a variety of processes, including reproduction, growth, migration patterns and phenology. Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particular]y important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle - the match or mismatch of predators' requirement with resource availability - originated in the marine literature, where it initially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis (MMH) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most apparent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbalancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {Predation mortality can influence the distribution and abundance of fish populations. While predation is often assessed using direct observations of prey consumption, potential predation can be predicted from co-occurring predator and prey densities under varying environmental conditions. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. (i.e., smolts) from the Columbia River Basin experience elevated mortality during the transition from estuarine to ocean habitat, but a thorough understanding of the role of predation remains incomplete. We used a Holling type II functional response to estimate smolt predation risk based on observations of piscivorous seabirds (sooty shearwater [Ardenna griseus] and common murre [Uria aalge]) and local densities of alternative prey fish including northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in Oregon and Washington coastal waters during May and June 2010-2012. We evaluated predation risk relative to the availability of alternative prey and physical factors including turbidity and Columbia River plume area, and compared risk to returns of adult salmon. Seabirds and smolts consistently co-occurred at sampling stations throughout most of the study area (mean = 0.79 ± 0.41, SD), indicating that juvenile salmon are regularly exposed to avian predators during early marine residence. Predation risk for juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), yearling Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and subyearling Chinook salmon was on average 70% lower when alternative prey were present. Predation risk was greater in turbid waters, and decreased as water clarity increased. Juvenile coho and yearling Chinook salmon predation risk was lower when river plume surface areas were greater than 15,000 km2, while the opposite was estimated for subyearling Chinook salmon. These results suggest that plume area, turbidity, and forage fish abundance near the mouth of the Columbia River, all of which are influenced by river discharge, are useful indicators of potential juvenile salmon mortality that could inform salmonid management.},

Consistent improvement in the skill of regional ocean models to predict physical ocean states at seasonal time scales provides opportunities to forecast biological responses to changing ecosystem conditions that impact fishery management practices. In this study, we used 8-month lead-time predictions of temperature at 250 m depth from the J-SCOPE regional ocean model, along with stationary habitat conditions (e.g., distance to shelf break), to forecast Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) distribution in the northern California Current Ecosystem (CCE). Using retrospective skill assessments, we found strong agreement between hake distribution forecasts and historical observations. The top performing models [based on out-of-sample skill assessments using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) skill metric] were a generalized additive model (GAM) that included shelf-break distance (i.e., distance to the 200 m isobath) (AUC = 0.813) and a boosted regression tree (BRT) that included temperature at 250 m depth and shelf-break distance (AUC = 0.830). An ensemble forecast of the top performing GAM and BRT models only improved out-of-sample forecast skill slightly (AUC = 0.838) due to strongly correlated forecast errors between models (r = 0.88). Collectively, our results demonstrate that seasonal lead-time ocean predictions have predictive skill for important ecological processes in the northern CCE and can be used to provide early detection of impending distribution shifts of ecologically and economically important marine species.},

abstract = {Ecological indicators are important mechanisms for understanding ecosystem change and implementing Ecosystem Based Fishery Management, but the development of useful indicators must account for ecosystem shifts that result in non-stationary processes over time. This necessitates the adoption of more adaptable statistical modeling approaches. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a robust framework for distinguishing underlying ecosystem shifts from noisy time-series data. In this paper, we illustrate the power of HMMs to develop model-based ecological indicators of non-stationary systems, focusing on two case studies from the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the first case study, we analyze four temperature time series from 1998 to 2022 that are used as indicators for environmental conditions experienced by juvenile salmon in the northern portion of the system. We apply a three-state HMM incorporating temporal trends to account for non-stationarity in the means over time due to overall ocean warming. Output from this model reveals increasing temperatures for all four metrics in the California Current, with most years being assigned to the warmest estimated state. In our second case study, we analyze nine time series of seabird densities in the northern California Current from 2003 to 2022, to demonstrate how HMMs can be useful to identify sets of indicators that reflect different ecosystem processes, including potential seabird predation pressure on juvenile salmon, and have different variances. We found the strongest support for the existence of two distinct temporal regimes in the seabird data, with an abrupt shift occurring after 2010. While mean densities changed slightly for some species, this regime shift can be best characterized with a shift in variances: sooty shearwaters (Ardenna grisea) and Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) represented species with densities becoming more variable, while common murres (Uria aalge) and gulls were estimated to have become less variable after 2010. Common murres, Cassin's auklets, sooty shearwaters, pink-footed shearwaters (Ardenna creatopus) and gulls all represent species that may be useful indicators of change in the northern California Current, because of their differential responses to this regime change. Overall, our analysis provides a first step illustrating the potential applications of HMMs to developing ecosystem indicators in non-stationary systems and a framework that is widely useful for applications to ecosystems around the world.},

abstract = {We hypothesise that salmon year class strength is determined in two stages during the first year in the ocean. There is an early natural mortality that is mostly related to predation, which is followed by a physiologically-based mortality. Juvenile salmon that fail to reach a critical size by the end of their first marine summer do not survive the following winter. In this study we describe our initial tests of this critical size and critical period hypothesis using data from ocean surveys of juvenile salmon and from experimental feeding studies on coho. Conservative swept volume abundance estimates for juvenile coho, and possibly chinook, indicate that there is high mortality in fall and winter during their first year in the sea. Studies of otolith weight show that the length and otolith-weight relationship for young coho changes in the early fall of their first ocean year. Studies of growth and associated hormone levels in feeding studies show that slow growing juvenile coho are stunted and deficient in an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Juvenile coho sampled in September had low IGF-I values, indicative of poor growth. The results of these studies provide evidence for the general hypothesis that growth-related mortality occurs late in the first marine year and may be important in determining the strength of the year class (brood year). The link between total mortality and climate could be operating via the availability of nutrients regulating the food supply and hence competition for food (i.e. bottom-up regulation). {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The second mortality is proposed to be how climate is linked to run year strength

The early life history of salmon and purely marine fish is so different; you'd expect salmon to be much less affected by the early critical period in the oceanic phase, because they are already juveniles at that point; in contrast, the egg/larvae stage for marine fish occurs out in the ocean, and they experience very high mortality then. But there is a lot of juvenile salmon mortality during early development (competition and predation while eggs or larvae) and during outmigration, obviously, because of predation and dam passage},

abstract = {Juvenile salmon Oncorhynchus spp. experience variable mortality rates during their first few months in the ocean, and high growth during this period is critical to minimize size-selective predation. Examining links between the physical environment and foraging ecology is important to understand mechanisms that drive growth. These mechanisms are complex and include interactions among the physical environment, forage availability, bioenergetics, and salmon foraging behavior. Our objectives were to explore how seascape features (biological and physical) influence juvenile Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha foraging at annual and feeding-event scales in the California Current Ecosystem. We demonstrate that forage abundance was the most influential determinant of mean salmon stomach fullness at the annual scale, while at the feeding-event scale, fullness increased with greater cumulative upwelling during the 10 d prior and at closer distances to thermal fronts. Upwelling promotes nutrient enrichment and productivity, while fronts concentrate organisms, likely resulting in available prey to salmon and increased stomach fullness. Salmon were also more likely to consume krill when there was high prior upwelling, and switched to non-krill invertebrates (i.e. amphipods, decapods, copepods) in weaker upwelling conditions. As salmon size increased from 72−250 mm, salmon were more likely to consume fish, equal amounts of krill, and fewer non-krill invertebrates. Broad seascape processes determined overall prey availability and fullness in a given year, while fine- and meso-scale processes influenced local accessibility of prey to individual salmon. Therefore, processes occurring at multiple scales will influence how marine organisms respond to changing environments.},

abstract = {Pacific Northwest Chinook, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, have exhibited a high degree of variability in smolt-to-adult survival over the past three decades. This variability is summarized for 22 Pacific Northwest stocks and analyzed using generalized linear modeling techniques. Results indicate that survival can be grouped into eight distinct regional clusters: (1) Alaska, Northern BC and North Georgia Strait; (2) Georgia Strait; (3) Lower Fraser River and West Coast Vancouver Island; (4) Puget Sound and Hood Canal; (5) Lower Columbia Tules; (6) Columbia Upriver Brights, Willamette and Cowlitz; (7) Oregon and Washington Coastal; and (8) Klamath River and Columbia River Summers. Further analysis for stocks within each of the eight regions indicates that local ocean conditions following the outmigration of smolts from freshwater to marine areas had a significant effect on survival for the majority of the stock groups analyzed. Our analyses of the data indicate that Pacific Northwest Chinook survival covaries on a spatial scale of 350-450km. Lagged time series models are presented that link large-scale tropical Pacific conditions, intermediate-basin scale northeastern Pacific conditions, and local sea surface temperatures to survival of Pacific Northwest stocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi (JM) and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (CM) are medium size pelagic fish predators and highly exploited resources. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of JM and CM diet composition using a large dataset of stomach samples collected from 1973 to 2013 along the Peruvian coast. In total 47,535 stomachs (18,377 CM and 29,158 JM) were analysed, of which 23,570 (12,476 CM and 11,094 JM) were non-empty. Results show that both species are opportunistic and present a trophic overlap. However, despite their smaller maximal size, CM consumed more fish than JM. Both diets presented high spatiotemporal variability. Spatially, the shelf break appears as a strong biogeographical barrier affecting prey species distribution and thus CM and JM diet. Opportunistic foragers are often considered as actual indicators of ecosystem changes; we show here that diet composition of CM and JM reveal ecosystem changes but is not always a good indicator of changes in prey biomass as prey accessibility and energy content can also play an important role. In addition we found that El Ni{\~{n}}o events have a surprisingly weak effect on stomach fullness and diet. Finally our results show that the classic paradigm of positive correlation between diversity and temperature is unlikely to occur in the Humboldt Current system where productivity seems to be the main driver. We show how energy content of forage species and the strength of the oxygen minimum zone most likely play an important role prey diversity and accessibility, and thus in fish foraging behaviour.},

abstract = {Ocean entry for salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) is a critical period during which recruitment to the adult population is likely set. During this period, predation risk will be modulated by availability of suitable prey at the time and location of out-migration. Therefore, identifying variables affecting the distribution of prey coast-wide facilitates ecosystem-based management of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha in the California Current. In this study, we quantified distributions of salmon forage assemblages relative to biogeographic breaks and ocean conditions along the California Current shelf ecosystem from Monterey Bay, California (36.5° N), to Willapa Bay, Washington (46.5° N). Epipelagic micronekton samples were collected during late springs of 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. We characterized (1) abundance of salmon forage taxa north and south of geographic boundaries, (2) spatial gradients in forage assemblages, and (3) relationships between environment and spatiotemporal variability of forage assemblages. We found higher abundances of market squid Doryteuthis opalescens, rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), and sanddabs (Citharichthys spp.) south of Cape Mendocino, while pandalid shrimp (Pandalus spp.), rex sole Glyptocephalus zachirus, and smelt (Osmeridae) were more abundant in the north. Multivariate analyses demonstrated a latitudinal gradient in the relative contribution (rank order) of individual taxa to salmon forage assemblages, and further analyses revealed the presence of 4 distinct multi-species assemblages associated with regional and meso-scale oceanographic dynamics. Our findings indicate that distributions of salmon forage assemblages and the oceanographic characteristics associated with those assemblages is similar to the spatial coherence of Chinook salmon population survival observed over longer time series.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving a rapid redistribution of life on Earth. Variability in the rates, magnitudes and directions of species' shifts can alter spatial overlap between predators and prey, with the potential to decouple trophic interactions. Although phenological mismatches between predator requirements and prey availability under climate change are well-established, ‘spatial match–mismatch' dynamics remain poorly understood. We synthesize global evidence for climate-driven changes in spatial predator–prey overlap resulting from species redistribution across marine and terrestrial domains. We show that spatial mismatches can have vastly different outcomes for predator populations depending on their diet specialization and role within the wider ecosystem. We illustrate ecosystem-level consequences of climate-driven changes in spatial predator–prey overlap, from restructuring food webs to altering socio-ecological interactions. It remains unclear how predator–prey overlap at the landscape scale relates to prey encounter and consumption rates at local scales, or how the spatial reorganization of food webs affects ecosystem function. We identify key research directions necessary to resolve the scale of ecological impacts caused by species redistribution under climate change.},

abstract = {—Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from the Strait of Georgia were used to test the hypothesis that slower growing fish in their first ocean year had lower survival over the late fall and winter than faster growing fish. The Strait of Georgia provided a suitable area for this study because it is a semi-enclosed rearing area for juvenile Pacific salmon that is distinct from the open marine rearing areas off the west coast. Coho salmon that survived the winter had significantly larger spacing between circuli on scales, indicating that brood year strength is related to growth in the first marine year. Other studies have shown that smaller fish of a cohort are less able to survive periods of energy deficit than larger fish. Thus, size-related mortality in the first marine fall and winter may be an important determinant of brood year strength of some coho salmon stocks and stocks of other species of Pacific salmon. In previous publications we proposed that most natural marine mortality of Pacific salmon Onco-rhynchus spp. in general and coho salmon O. kis-utch in particular occurred in two major episodes (Beamish and Mahnken 1999, 2001). The first ep-isode, predation in the early marine period, is com-monly believed to be the major determinant of brood year size (Parker 1968; Pearcy 1992). We hypothesized that a second major episode of mor-tality occurred later in the year and was related to growth. According to our hypothesis, Pacific salm-on had to achieve a sufficient size by the end of the first marine summer to be able to survive the metabolic demands during a period of energy def-icit in the late fall and winter. This critical-size and critical-period hypothesis linked natural mor-tality directly to the productivity of the ocean eco-system and indirectly to climate and climate change. We examined scales of coho salmon to assess size-dependant mortality. The spacing between circuli is an index of relative growth among in-dividuals within a cohort because scale growth and circuli formation are a permanent record of growth},

The individual and population-level impacts of prolonged heatwaves on marine species have recently been demonstrated, yet whole-ecosystem consequences remain unexplored. We leveraged time series abundance data of 361 taxa, grouped into 86 functional groups, from six long-term surveys, diet information from a new diet database, and previous modeling efforts, to build two food web networks using an extension of the popular Ecopath ecosystem modeling framework, Ecotran. We compare ecosystem models parameterized before and after the onset of recent marine heatwaves to evaluate the cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. While the ecosystem-level contribution (prey) and demand (predators) of most functional groups changed following the heatwaves, gelatinous taxa experienced the largest transformations, underscored by the arrival of northward-expanding pyrosomes. We show altered trophic relationships and energy flux have potentially profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function, and raise concerns for populations of threatened and harvested species.},

abstract = {The viability of populations is influenced by driving forces such as density dependence and climate variability, but most population viability analyses (PVAs) ignore these factors because of data limitations. Additionally, simplified PVAs produce limited measures of population viability such as annual population growth rate ($\lambda$) or extinction risk. Here we developed a "mechanistic" PVA of threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in which, based on 40 years of detailed data, we related freshwater recruitment of juveniles to density of spawners, and third-year survival in the ocean to monthly indices of broad-scale ocean and climate conditions. Including climate variability in the model produced important effects: estimated population viability was very sensitive to assumptions of future climate conditions and the autocorrelation contained in the climate signal increased mean population abundance while increasing probability of quasi extinction. Because of the presence of density dependence in the model, however, we could not distinguish among alternative climate scenarios through mean $\lambda$ values, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple measures to elucidate population viability. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the importance of particular parameters varied across models and depended on which viability measure was the response variable. The density-dependent parameter associated with freshwater recruitment was consistently the most important, regardless of viability measure, suggesting that increasing juvenile carrying capacity is important for recovery. {\textcopyright}2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {The common practice of incorporating environmental indices into population models has greatly advanced our understanding of ecological systems. Unfortunately, we are increasingly seeing published correlations between population indicators and environmental indices breaking down when tested with new data. Examining how the correlations among indices change over time could help explain underlying causal mechanisms, which ultimately strengthen the basis for prediction of population indicators. For migratory animals such as anadromous salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), the habitat conditions they experience can affect their lifetime fitness and population viability. We analyzed 43 freshwater, marine, and climate indices associated with 72 river sites and five coastal ecoregions inhabited by Chinook and coho salmon (O. tshawytscha and O. kisutch) in the western USA. Utilizing long time series (ranging from 32 to 124 years), we examined spatial and temporal patterns in correlations through hierarchical clustering across sites and non-stationarity across time. Individual river sites clustered into two Northwest and one Southwest groups. Northwest sites generally showed stronger correlations between freshwater and climate indices, while Southwest sites showed stronger correlations within freshwater or within marine/climate indices. For a closer examination at shorter periods, we parsed the time series into 10-year windows and showed how pairwise correlations changed over time with spring–summer Pacific Decadal Oscillation index in the Northwest and with spring flow in the Southwest. Stronger correlations across multiple indices tended to occur when large-scale climatic events (e.g., Oceanic Ni{\~{n}}o and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices) were in-phase, and phase transitions (e.g., from positive to negative) occurred in the same 10-year window. In a third analysis, we assessed how well indices provided unique vs. confounding/complex information and had consistent vs. varying relationships based on the mean and variance of 10-year correlations. Across index types, the variance in correlations tended to be lowest in marine vs. climate indices, higher among freshwater indices, and highest for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices. Yet, the mean strength of correlations for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices was still comparable to those among freshwater ones. Overall, identifying time periods when correlations tend to change will help interpret historical and projected population indicators. Spatial trends in the strength of correlations also indicate that the level of confounding effects among indices can differ regionally. We emphasize the importance of knowing the strength and variability of correlations among indices, and their representativeness of ecological processes in the context of combined phases of multiple climatic indices.},
