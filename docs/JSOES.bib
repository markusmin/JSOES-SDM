abstract = {Data on young-of-the-year rockfish, Sebastes spp., were analyzed from two midwater trawl surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science Center Fisheries Ecology Division and the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative from 2001 to 2005. Length-frequency data for Sebastes spp. from the two surveys showed interannual and geographic variability. Examination of side-by-side vessel paired trawls indicated a disparity in the 2001 and 2002 data, while for 2003 to 2005 the Sebastes spp. catch data and species richness were comparable. Comparison of the mean log-transformed catches of Sebastes spp. from the two surveys showed significant inter-survey differences in 2001 and 2002, but results for 2003 to 2005 were similar. Given the concordance between the two surveys from 2003 to 2005, those data were pooled and abundance patterns by latitude and year were examined for S. entomelas, S. flavidus, S. jordani, S. mystinus, S. pau-cispinis, and S. pinniger.},

abstract = {In the Northern California Current (NCC), zooplankton communities show interannual and multiyear shifts in species dominance that are tracked by survival of salmon populations. These zooplankton community changes correlate with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index: a 'warm-water' copepod species group is more abundant during warm (positive) phases of the PDO and less abundant during cold (negative) phases; the reverse occurs for a 'cold-water' species group. The observed relationship led to the hypothesis that the relative dominance of warm/cold-water copepods in the NCC is driven by changes in the horizontal advection of surface water over different phases of the PDO. To test this hypothesis, variation in surface water advection to coastal regions of the NCC over the period of 1950-2008 was investigated using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and passive tracer experiments, then was compared with zooplankton collected off Oregon since 1996. Results showed that surface water advection varied with the phase of the PDO; the low-frequency component of advection anomalies strongly correlated with copepod species composition (R>0.9). During positive phases of the PDO, current anomalies were northward and onshore, resulting in transport of warmer waters and the associated copepods into the region. During negatives phases, increased equatorward current anomalies led to a copepod community that was dominated by cold-water taxa. Our results support the hypothesis that climate-driven changes in basin-scale circulation controls copepod community composition in the NCC, and demonstrate that large-scale climate forcings downscale to influence local and regional ecosystem structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Several evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Columbia River asin Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Coho Salmon O. kisutch are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Yet little is known about the spatial and temporal distributions of these ESUs immediately following ocean entry, when year-class success may be determined. We documented differences in dispersal patterns during the early ocean period among groups defined by ESU, adult run timing, and smolt age. Between 1995 and 2006, 1,896 coded-wire-tagged juvenile fish from the Columbia River basin were recovered during 6,142 research trawl events along the West Coast of North America. Three distinct ocean dispersal patterns were observed: (1) age-1 (yearling) mid and upper Columbia River spring-run and Snake River spring-summer-run Chinook Salmon migrated rapidly northward and by late summer were not found south of Vancouver Island; (2) age-0 (subyearling) lower Columbia River fall, upper Columbia River summer, upper Columbia River fall, and Snake River fall Chinook Salmon dispersed slowly, remaining mainly south of Vancouver Island through autumn; and (3) age-1 lower Columbia River spring, upper Columbia River summer, and upper Willamette River spring Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon were widespread along the coast from summer through fall, indicating a diversity of dispersal rates. Generally, the ocean dispersal of age-1 fish was faster and more extensive than that of age-0 fish, with some age-1 fish migrating as fast as 10-40 km/d (0.5-3.0 body lengths/s). Within groups, interannual variation in dispersal was moderate. Identification of the distinct temporal and spatial ocean distribution patterns of juvenile salmon from Columbia River basin ESUs is important in order to evaluate the potential influence of changing ocean conditions on the survival and long term sustainability of these fish populations.

abstract = {Euphausiids, or krill, are important energy links between primary producers and higher trophic levels in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), but a thorough understanding of their variability at the coast-wide scale is limited. Using fisheries acoustics data collected during biennial joint US-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Acoustic Trawl Surveys for Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), we developed a time series (n = 8 years; 2007-2019 odd years inclusive, and 2012) of krill abundance and examined relationships with environmental factors. Krill were located in waters off the west coasts of the United States and Canada, primarily in shallow basins and on the continental shelf, with greatest kernel density estimates near Cape Mendocino and the Juan de Fuca eddy system. Coast-wide krill abundance was variable, and lowest in 2015 during an extended marine heat wave, when 91% were located in British Columbia. Using hierarchical generalized additive models, we predicted greatest krill abundance in cooler waters (0.2°C below the time series average), within 10-20 km of the shelf break, and in bottom depths between 200 and 400 m. This newly developed coast-wide time series of krill abundance and distribution will inform ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts, and offers additional opportunities for studies of krill-dependent fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

abstract = {From 1998 to 2003, we observed large fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of four pelagic predatory (piscivorous) fishes off northern Oregon and southern Washington, USA. Fluctuations in predatory fish species composition and abundance were strongly linked to the date of the spring transition and to ocean temperatures. Predatory fishes, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonids had distinct spatial distributions, with predators distributed primarily offshore and forage fish and salmonids onshore, but this varied depending on ocean conditions. We suggest that predatory and forage fish distributions respond to ocean temperatures, predator/prey interactions, and possibly turbidity. A shift in ocean conditions in 1999 decreased overall predator fish abundance in the Columbia River plume, particularly for Pacific hake. Marine survival of juvenile salmon started to increase in 1999, and forage fish densities increased in 2000, lagging by one year. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain >90% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. In general, models with year, day and day2 had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4-50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

We construct the first coastwide state-space model for fall Chinook salmon tagged fish released from California to British Columbia between 1977 and 1990 to estimate seasonal ocean distribution along the west coast of North America. We incorporate recoveries from multiple ocean fisheries and allow for regional variation in fisheries vulnerability and maturation. We show that Chinook salmon ocean distribution depends strongly on region of origin and varies seasonally, while survival showed regionally varying temporal patterns. Simulations incorporating juvenile production data provide proportional stock composition in different ocean regions and the first coastwide projections of Chinook salmon aggregate abundance. Our model provides an extendable framework that can be applied to understand drivers of Chinook salmon biology (e.g., climate effects on ocean distribution) and management effects (e.g., consequences of juvenile production changes).},

abstract = {The common practice of incorporating environmental indices into population models has greatly advanced our understanding of ecological systems. Unfortunately, we are increasingly seeing published correlations between population indicators and environmental indices breaking down when tested with new data. Examining how the correlations among indices change over time could help explain underlying causal mechanisms, which ultimately strengthen the basis for prediction of population indicators. For migratory animals such as anadromous salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), the habitat conditions they experience can affect their lifetime fitness and population viability. We analyzed 43 freshwater, marine, and climate indices associated with 72 river sites and five coastal ecoregions inhabited by Chinook and coho salmon (O. tshawytscha and O. kisutch) in the western USA. Utilizing long time series (ranging from 32 to 124 years), we examined spatial and temporal patterns in correlations through hierarchical clustering across sites and non-stationarity across time. Individual river sites clustered into two Northwest and one Southwest groups. Northwest sites generally showed stronger correlations between freshwater and climate indices, while Southwest sites showed stronger correlations within freshwater or within marine/climate indices. For a closer examination at shorter periods, we parsed the time series into 10-year windows and showed how pairwise correlations changed over time with spring–summer Pacific Decadal Oscillation index in the Northwest and with spring flow in the Southwest. Stronger correlations across multiple indices tended to occur when large-scale climatic events (e.g., Oceanic Ni{\~{n}}o and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices) were in-phase, and phase transitions (e.g., from positive to negative) occurred in the same 10-year window. In a third analysis, we assessed how well indices provided unique vs. confounding/complex information and had consistent vs. varying relationships based on the mean and variance of 10-year correlations. Across index types, the variance in correlations tended to be lowest in marine vs. climate indices, higher among freshwater indices, and highest for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices. Yet, the mean strength of correlations for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices was still comparable to those among freshwater ones. Overall, identifying time periods when correlations tend to change will help interpret historical and projected population indicators. Spatial trends in the strength of correlations also indicate that the level of confounding effects among indices can differ regionally. We emphasize the importance of knowing the strength and variability of correlations among indices, and their representativeness of ecological processes in the context of combined phases of multiple climatic indices.},

abstract = {Eastern boundary current (EBC) upwelling zones are among the most productive of marine ecosystems globally and have been generalized in terms of their food web structure. Little empirically based evidence exists to suggest that there is any one form of trophic control of EBC systems and, because of logistical constraints, knowledge of food web structure is limited in these large marine ecosystems. To determine principal trophic links within the pelagic food web, we combined stable isotope and diet analysis of 21 dominant species of nekton found within the northern California Current, a highly productive EBC upwelling ecosystem. Samples of nekton and zooplankton were collected in June and August 2000 and 2002 from the shelf-slope waters of northern California to Washington. Results showed most nekton consumed mixed diets of zooplankton and larval-juvenile or adult fishes, indicating the importance of omnivory in this system. Euphausiids were overwhelmingly the most prevalent zooplankton taxa in the diets of nekton across multiple trophic levels, accounting for >50% of the index of relative importance in 10 of 21 nekton species analyzed. Nitrogen stable isotopes ($\delta$15N) reflected trophic patterns observed in the diets, with most nekton species (∼62%) falling between trophic levels (TL) of full zooplanktivores (TL = 3) and full piscivores (TL = 4). The prevalence of omnivory observed here is probably due to high primary production that supports an abundance of large zooplankton prey, such as euphausiids, which may be a more available prey resource for a broad range of predators. A modification of this form of bottom-up control, termed bottom-up omnivory, is presented. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

This prompted the development and implementation of two separate management plans, one in the Columbia River estuary and the other in the Columbia Plateau region, to reduce the impact of Caspian tern predation on smolt survival. Caspian terns nesting at managed breeding colonies within the basin were relocated to alternative nesting islands created for terns outside the basin. Both plans were successful in significantly reducing smolt losses to Caspian terns nesting at managed sites; however, new developments have led to regression in smolt survival gains associated with tern management. Adaptive management to prevent terns at managed colonies from relocating to nest elsewhere in the basin and to improve nesting opportunities for Caspian terns outside the basin are needed to maximize the survival benefits to Endangered Species Act-listed salmonids from management. Adaptive management is also necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the Pacific Flyway population of Caspian terns, whose breeding population has declined by more than 50% since the two management plans were implemented.},

abstract = {Ecological indicators are important mechanisms for understanding ecosystem change and implementing Ecosystem Based Fishery Management, but the development of useful indicators must account for ecosystem shifts that result in non-stationary processes over time. This necessitates the adoption of more adaptable statistical modeling approaches. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a robust framework for distinguishing underlying ecosystem shifts from noisy time-series data. In this paper, we illustrate the power of HMMs to develop model-based ecological indicators of non-stationary systems, focusing on two case studies from the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the first case study, we analyze four temperature time series from 1998 to 2022 that are used as indicators for environmental conditions experienced by juvenile salmon in the northern portion of the system. We apply a three-state HMM incorporating temporal trends to account for non-stationarity in the means over time due to overall ocean warming. Output from this model reveals increasing temperatures for all four metrics in the California Current, with most years being assigned to the warmest estimated state. In our second case study, we analyze nine time series of seabird densities in the northern California Current from 2003 to 2022, to demonstrate how HMMs can be useful to identify sets of indicators that reflect different ecosystem processes, including potential seabird predation pressure on juvenile salmon, and have different variances. We found the strongest support for the existence of two distinct temporal regimes in the seabird data, with an abrupt shift occurring after 2010. While mean densities changed slightly for some species, this regime shift can be best characterized with a shift in variances: sooty shearwaters (Ardenna grisea) and Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) represented species with densities becoming more variable, while common murres (Uria aalge) and gulls were estimated to have become less variable after 2010. Common murres, Cassin's auklets, sooty shearwaters, pink-footed shearwaters (Ardenna creatopus) and gulls all represent species that may be useful indicators of change in the northern California Current, because of their differential responses to this regime change. Overall, our analysis provides a first step illustrating the potential applications of HMMs to developing ecosystem indicators in non-stationary systems and a framework that is widely useful for applications to ecosystems around the world.},

abstract = {Jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi (JM) and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (CM) are medium size pelagic fish predators and highly exploited resources. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of JM and CM diet composition using a large dataset of stomach samples collected from 1973 to 2013 along the Peruvian coast. In total 47,535 stomachs (18,377 CM and 29,158 JM) were analysed, of which 23,570 (12,476 CM and 11,094 JM) were non-empty. Results show that both species are opportunistic and present a trophic overlap. However, despite their smaller maximal size, CM consumed more fish than JM. Both diets presented high spatiotemporal variability. Spatially, the shelf break appears as a strong biogeographical barrier affecting prey species distribution and thus CM and JM diet. Opportunistic foragers are often considered as actual indicators of ecosystem changes; we show here that diet composition of CM and JM reveal ecosystem changes but is not always a good indicator of changes in prey biomass as prey accessibility and energy content can also play an important role. In addition we found that El Ni{\~{n}}o events have a surprisingly weak effect on stomach fullness and diet. Finally our results show that the classic paradigm of positive correlation between diversity and temperature is unlikely to occur in the Humboldt Current system where productivity seems to be the main driver. We show how energy content of forage species and the strength of the oxygen minimum zone most likely play an important role prey diversity and accessibility, and thus in fish foraging behaviour.},

abstract = {Early ocean residence is considered a critical period for juvenile salmon although specific survival mechanisms are often unidentified and may vary by species or life stage. Columbia River spring-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha abundance has declined dramatically since the early 1900s. To elucidate mechanisms of early marine survival, we tested the 'bigger-is-better' and 'stage-duration' aspects of the 'growth-mortality' hypothesis, which posits that size and growth rate are important for future abundance. We tested the 'match-mismatch' hypothesis to determine whether early marine growth was related to indices related to regional productivity, including spring transition timing and copepod community composition. We generated estimates of individual size at ocean entry and capture, marine growth rate, early marine migration rate, and emigration timing using data from ocean surveys, genetic stock-assignment, and otolith analyses of juveniles collected across 8 yr between 1998 and 2008. Size at capture and marine growth rate after $\sim$30 d marine residence were positively related to future adult returns, whereas size at marine entry was not. Growth rate was not significantly related to indices of secondary production, but size at capture was significantly greater when lipid-rich copepods dominated. Although future adult abundance was not related to emigration timing, juveniles migrated more slowly when copepod biomass was high, perhaps responding to foraging conditions. Overall, processes during early ocean residence appear to be more important for cohort size establishment than those at marine entry. Approaches that combine genetic and otolith analyses have great potential to provide information on stock-specific variation in survival mechanisms. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Determining which factors are most effective for mitigative strategies in conservation management can be difficult for species with complex life cycles. Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating through a hydroelectric power system experience conditions that can affect their survival directly within a life stage and indirectly in subsequent life stages through carryover effects. We quantified the association of covariates with survival across life stages of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha): juveniles migrating downstream, juveniles in the estuary, subadults in the ocean, and adults migrating upstream. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian mark–recapture model to $\sim$400,000 wild Snake River Chinook salmon (Pacific Northwest, USA). Modeled covariates of survival included migration timing, river temperature, flow, percent of water spilled over dams, snow water equivalent, juvenile fish transportation, juvenile fish length, dam powerhouse passage, sea surface temperature, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. By analyzing these covariates in a unified model, we evaluated their relationships to survival within and across life stages in a common currency. Among direct effects, the negative relationship of sea surface temperature to ocean survival had the largest marginal effect size. Carryover effects also had substantial marginal effect sizes. Ocean survival was associated positively with juvenile length and snow water equivalent and negatively with river temperature. In comparison, direct effects on juvenile and adult survival generally showed smaller marginal effect sizes. Both juvenile and adult survival were negatively associated with river temperature. Juvenile survival increased with fish length, while adult survival was positively related to flow and negatively to percent water spilled at dams. The greatest variability in survival, however, was in the ocean stage. Thus, as the ocean continues to warm and as the human population exerts more pressure on the ecosystem, carryover effects will be increasingly important for recovering salmon and other migratory species.},

abstract = {Objective: Because predation is thought to be the primary source of natural mortality for juvenile salmon first entering the ocean, we sought to identify regions where, on average, stock-specific spatial overlap between the distribution of threatened and endangered juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and abundant fish-eating seabirds (common murres Uria aalge and sooty shearwaters Ardenna grisea) suggests the greatest potential for ocean predation risk to juvenile Chinook Salmon. Methods: The relative abundance and spatial distribution of seabird predators and juvenile Chinook Salmon were quantified as part of long-term ecosystem surveys during May 2003–2012 and June 2003–2022. Genetic stock identification methods were used to assign individual fish to their respective stock groups. Stock-specific species distribution models then generated maps and indices of average annual spatial overlap between predators and prey within the survey area. Result: There is unequivocal evidence for spatial overlap between common murres, sooty shearwaters, and five genetic groups of interior and lower Columbia River juvenile Chinook Salmon. We found strongly positive (≥0.70) spatial correlations between predator and prey densities in both May and June, although spatial overlap was, in general, greater during May. The region of highest spatial overlap occurred on the inner continental shelf between the Columbia River mouth (46.2°N) and Grays Harbor (47.0°N), a region at the beginning of the juvenile salmon migratory pathway that is strongly affected by freshwater outflow from the river. Conclusion: Our findings support the idea that ocean avian predation during early marine residence has the potential to affect marine survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon and should be further investigated to better inform and implement ecological models and possible recovery actions for Chinook Salmon populations of the Columbia River basin.},

This variability is summarized for 22 Pacific Northwest stocks and analyzed using generalized linear modeling techniques. Results indicate that survival can be grouped into eight distinct regional clusters: (1) Alaska, Northern BC and North Georgia Strait; (2) Georgia Strait; (3) Lower Fraser River and West Coast Vancouver Island; (4) Puget Sound and Hood Canal; (5) Lower Columbia Tules; (6) Columbia Upriver Brights, Willamette and Cowlitz; (7) Oregon and Washington Coastal; and (8) Klamath River and Columbia River Summers. Further analysis for stocks within each of the eight regions indicates that local ocean conditions following the outmigration of smolts from freshwater to marine areas had a significant effect on survival for the majority of the stock groups analyzed. Our analyses of the data indicate that Pacific Northwest Chinook survival covaries on a spatial scale of 350-450km. Lagged time series models are presented that link large-scale tropical Pacific conditions, intermediate-basin scale northeastern Pacific conditions, and local sea surface temperatures to survival of Pacific Northwest stocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The viability of populations is influenced by driving forces such as density dependence and climate variability, but most population viability analyses (PVAs) ignore these factors because of data limitations. Additionally, simplified PVAs produce limited measures of population viability such as annual population growth rate ($\lambda$) or extinction risk. Here we developed a "mechanistic" PVA of threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in which, based on 40 years of detailed data, we related freshwater recruitment of juveniles to density of spawners, and third-year survival in the ocean to monthly indices of broad-scale ocean and climate conditions. Including climate variability in the model produced important effects: estimated population viability was very sensitive to assumptions of future climate conditions and the autocorrelation contained in the climate signal increased mean population abundance while increasing probability of quasi extinction. Because of the presence of density dependence in the model, however, we could not distinguish among alternative climate scenarios through mean $\lambda$ values, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple measures to elucidate population viability. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the importance of particular parameters varied across models and depended on which viability measure was the response variable. The density-dependent parameter associated with freshwater recruitment was consistently the most important, regardless of viability measure, suggesting that increasing juvenile carrying capacity is important for recovery. {\textcopyright}2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Here we present the California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) for the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean over the past century, assimilating over 190 published records of predator food habits for over 100 predator species and 32 categories of forage taxa (species or groups of similar species). Literature searches targeted all predators that consumed forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate. Diet data were compiled into a relational database. Analysis of the CCPDD highlighted differences in predator diet data availability based on geography, time period and predator taxonomy, as well as prominent prey categories. The top 5 forage taxa with the most predators included juvenile rockfish, northern anchovy, euphausiid krill, Pacific herring and market squid. Predator species with abundant data included Pacific hake, common murre, and California sea lion. Most diet data were collected during the summer; the lack of winter data will restrict future use of the CCPDD to understand seasonal patterns in predator diet unless more such data become available. Increased synthesis of historical information can provide new resources to understand patterns in the role of forage species in predator diet. Increased publication and/or accessibility of long-term datasets and data-sharing will further foster the synthesis of information intended to inform the management, conservation and understanding of marine food webs.},

abstract = {—Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from the Strait of Georgia were used to test the hypothesis that slower growing fish in their first ocean year had lower survival over the late fall and winter than faster growing fish. The Strait of Georgia provided a suitable area for this study because it is a semi-enclosed rearing area for juvenile Pacific salmon that is distinct from the open marine rearing areas off the west coast. Coho salmon that survived the winter had significantly larger spacing between circuli on scales, indicating that brood year strength is related to growth in the first marine year. Other studies have shown that smaller fish of a cohort are less able to survive periods of energy deficit than larger fish. Thus, size-related mortality in the first marine fall and winter may be an important determinant of brood year strength of some coho salmon stocks and stocks of other species of Pacific salmon. In previous publications we proposed that most natural marine mortality of Pacific salmon Onco-rhynchus spp. in general and coho salmon O. kis-utch in particular occurred in two major episodes (Beamish and Mahnken 1999, 2001). The first ep-isode, predation in the early marine period, is com-monly believed to be the major determinant of brood year size (Parker 1968; Pearcy 1992). We hypothesized that a second major episode of mor-tality occurred later in the year and was related to growth. According to our hypothesis, Pacific salm-on had to achieve a sufficient size by the end of the first marine summer to be able to survive the metabolic demands during a period of energy def-icit in the late fall and winter. This critical-size and critical-period hypothesis linked natural mor-tality directly to the productivity of the ocean eco-system and indirectly to climate and climate change. We examined scales of coho salmon to assess size-dependant mortality. The spacing between circuli is an index of relative growth among in-dividuals within a cohort because scale growth and circuli formation are a permanent record of growth},

Ocean conditions may influence this energy pathway in the Northern California Current (NCC) ecosystem, and we may expect it to differ between warm and cold periods in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The recent unprecedented warming in the NCC provides a unique opportunity to better understand the connection between ocean conditions and forage fish feeding habits and the potential consequences for predators that depend on them for sustenance. Here we present findings from gut content analysis to examine food sources of multiple forage fishes (northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax, jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus, Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus, and whitebait smelt Allosmerus elongatus) off the Washington and Oregon coasts. Analyses were applied to fish collected in May and June during recent warm years (2015 and 2016) and compared to previous collections made during cool (2011, 2012) and average (2000, 2002) years. Results of the diet analysis indicate that fish feeding habits varied significantly between cold and both average and warm periods. Euphausiids, decapods, and copepods were the main prey items of the forage fishes for most years examined; however, gelatinous zooplankton were consumed in much higher quantities in warm years compared to cold years. This shift in prey availability was also seen in plankton and trawl surveys in recent years and suggests that changing ocean conditions are likely to affect the type and quality of prey available to forage fish. Although gelatinous zooplankton are generally not believed to be suitable prey for most fishes due to their low energy content, some forage fishes may utilize this prey in the absence of more preferred prey resources during anomalously warm ocean conditions.},

It has become more common to use stable isotopes to supplement traditional diet studies of salmon in the ocean; however, there have been no integrated syntheses of these data to determine whether stable isotope analyses support the existing conventional wisdom of feeding strategies of the Pacific salmon. We performed a meta-analysis of stable isotope data to examine the extent of trophic partitioning among five species of Pacific salmon during their marine lives. Pink, sockeye, and chum salmon showed very high overlap in resource use and there was no consistent evidence for chum relying on alternative food webs dominated by gelatinous zooplankton. $\delta$15N showed that Chinook and coho salmon fed at trophic levels higher than the other three species. In addition, these two species were distinctly enriched in 13C, suggesting more extensive use of coastal food webs compared to the more depleted (pelagic) signatures of pink, sockeye, and chum salmon. This paper presents the first synthesis of stable isotope work on Pacific salmon and provides $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values applicable to research on the fate of the marine derived nutrients these organisms transport to freshwater and riparian ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Forage fishes are ecologically and economically important in marine ecosystems worldwide and thus are a focal topic for ecosystem-based fisheries management. In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), the community dynamics of forage populations have been studied at regional spatial scales, but not across regions. To evaluate indicators of the forage community at the ecosystem-wide scale, we examine temporal variability of forage assemblages in Northern (Oregon/Washington), Central (California; Point Reyes to Monterey Bay) and Southern (southern California) regions of the CCLME from 1998 through 2016 which include years with unprecedented climate variability. Forage communities fluctuated greatly between years within each region owing to regionally low abundances of common taxa in at least some years (e.g., rockfishes Sebastes spp. in each region). Comparison of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Ni{\~{n}}o to La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013–2014. Changes in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context on spatio-temporal changes in the structure of forage fish communities important to top predators in this system.},

For migrating species, such as salmonids that move through multiple habitats, these correlations can amplify the impact of good or poor physical conditions on growth and survival, as movements among habitats may not alleviate effects of anomalous conditions. Unfortunately, identifying the mechanistic drivers of salmon survival in space and time is hindered by these cross-habitat correlations. To address this issue, we modeled the marine survival of Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon with multiple indices of the marine environment and an explicit treatment of the effect of arrival timing from freshwater to the ocean, and found that both habitats contribute to marine survival rates. We show how this particular carryover effect of freshwater conditions on marine survival varies by year and rearing type (hatchery or wild), with a larger effect for wild fish. As environmental conditions change, incorporating effects from both freshwater and marine habitats into salmon survival models will become more important, and has the additional benefit of highlighting how management actions that affect arrival timing may improve marine survival.},

abstract = {We hypothesise that salmon year class strength is determined in two stages during the first year in the ocean. There is an early natural mortality that is mostly related to predation, which is followed by a physiologically-based mortality. Juvenile salmon that fail to reach a critical size by the end of their first marine summer do not survive the following winter. In this study we describe our initial tests of this critical size and critical period hypothesis using data from ocean surveys of juvenile salmon and from experimental feeding studies on coho. Conservative swept volume abundance estimates for juvenile coho, and possibly chinook, indicate that there is high mortality in fall and winter during their first year in the sea. Studies of otolith weight show that the length and otolith-weight relationship for young coho changes in the early fall of their first ocean year. Studies of growth and associated hormone levels in feeding studies show that slow growing juvenile coho are stunted and deficient in an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Juvenile coho sampled in September had low IGF-I values, indicative of poor growth. The results of these studies provide evidence for the general hypothesis that growth-related mortality occurs late in the first marine year and may be important in determining the strength of the year class (brood year). The link between total mortality and climate could be operating via the availability of nutrients regulating the food supply and hence competition for food (i.e. bottom-up regulation). {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

annote = {paper describes a mechanism that is hypothesized to explain climate-salmon links, based on two sources of mortality: 1) immediately after smolts enter saltwater, primarily via predation, and 2) in fall/winter, when individuals that have not reached a critical size die because they are unable to meet minimum metabolic requirements. The second mortality is proposed to be how climate is linked to run year strength

The early life history of salmon and purely marine fish is so different; you'd expect salmon to be much less affected by the early critical period in the oceanic phase, because they are already juveniles at that point; in contrast, the egg/larvae stage for marine fish occurs out in the ocean, and they experience very high mortality then. But there is a lot of juvenile salmon mortality during early development (competition and predation while eggs or larvae) and during outmigration, obviously, because of predation and dam passage},

abstract = { Successfully shifting to a more piscivorous diet may be an important factor in the growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha during their first summer in the northern California Current. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of diets by size showed several distinct groupings as the salmon grew during their first marine summer. These size‐based diet differences were clearly driven by increased rates of piscivory for both species. Fish prey composition, feeding intensity, and fish prey–predator length ratios all significantly increased for coho salmon at approximately 240 mm fork length when they changed from diets dominated by juvenile rockfishes Sebastes spp., the larvae of crabs Cancer spp., and adult euphausiids to one of predominantly juvenile forage fish. As Chinook salmon grew, they gradually increased the proportional contribution (by weight) of fish prey in their diets—from 55% in the smallest length‐class examined (80–100 mm) to 95% in the largest one (>375 mm). Chinook salmon fed in the same marine environments as coho salmon and consistently ate more and longer fish prey at a given size than coho salmon but had lower overall feeding intensity, perhaps owing to a higher level of prey selection. Relating subsequent interannual adult salmon returns to juvenile diets showed mixed results. During lower‐survival years, coho salmon ate fewer and smaller fish prey, while subyearling Chinook salmon had less total food and more empty stomachs. We did not find consistent trophic patterns for yearling Chinook salmon in relation to their ultimate survival. },

The occurrence of contrasting environmental conditions provided an excellent opportunity to examine pelagic nekton distributions and their abiotic and biotic associations. Pelagic surface trawl surveys conducted during June and September from 1998 to 2002 off northern Washington to central Oregon revealed a nekton community dominated by Pacific herring (33.5% of total catch), Pacific sardines (29.9%), and northern anchovy (12.3%). Between 1998 and 2002, species composition shifted from a community dominated by southern species (mackerels and hake) to one dominated by northern species (squid, smelts, and salmon), but the transition was gradual, and small pelagic species (sardines, herring, and anchovy) showed no consistent trends in abundance over time. Species diversity/evenness was highest in September 2002. Cluster analysis identified 7 species and 6 station clusters. Subyearling Chinook salmon, market squid, Pacific sardine, yearling coho salmon, and Pacific saury were the strongest indicator species for 5 of these cluster groups. Cluster group distributions differed between both inshore/offshore and north/south. A 3-dimensional ordination explained 55% of the total variance with bottom depth, distance from shore, and sea-surface temperature correlated with the first axis, latitude with the second axis, and surface salinity, surface density and stability with the third axis. Our results suggest that the habitats occupied by pelagic nekton species expand and contract in relation to the dynamic nature of the California Current and are affected by changing ocean conditions at both seasonal and interannual periodicities. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

These changes apparently began around a 1988/1989 North Pacific climate shift that was marked by abrupt northeast Pacific warming, declining temporal variance in the Aleutian Low (a leading atmospheric driver of the PDO), and increasing correlation between the PDO and NPGO patterns. Sea level pressure and surface temperature patterns associated with each climate index changed after 1988/1989, indicating that identical index values reflect different states of basin-scale climate over time. The PDO and NPGO also show time-dependent skill as indices of regional northeast Pacific ecosystem variability. Since the late 1980s, both indices have become less relevant to physical-ecological variability in regional ecosystems from the Bering Sea to the southern California Current. Users of these climate indices should be aware of nonstationary relationships with underlying climate variability within the historical record, and the potential for further nonstationarity with ongoing climate change.},

Pacific salmon abundance has been highly variable over the last few decades and most forecasting models have proven inadequate, primarily because of a lack of understanding of the processes affecting variability in survival. Better methods and data for predicting the abundance of returning adults are therefore required to effectively manage the species. We combined 31 distinct indicators of the marine environment collected over an 11-year period into a multivariate analysis to summarize and predict adult spring Chinook salmon returns to the Columbia River in 2012. In addition to forecasts, this tool quantifies the strength of the relationship between various ecological indicators and salmon returns, allowing interpretation of ecosystem processes. The relative importance of indicators varied, but a few trends emerged. Adult returns of spring Chinook salmon were best described using indicators of bottom-up ecological processes such as composition and abundance of zooplankton and fish prey as well as measures of individual fish, such as growth and condition. Local indicators of temperature or coastal upwelling did not contribute as much as large-scale indicators of temperature variability, matching the spatial scale over which salmon spend the majority of their ocean residence. Results suggest that effective management of Pacific salmon requires multiple types of data and that no single indicator can represent the complex early-ocean ecology of salmon.},

Marine survival was most strongly related to the average body size in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. This relationship was consistent over multiple years (1997-2002), suggesting that mortality after July is strongly size-dependent. Release size and date only slightly improved this relationship, whereas size in September showed little relationship to marine survival. Specifically, fish that experienced the highest marine survivals were released before 25 May and were larger than 17 g (or 120 mm fork length) by July. Our findings highlight the importance of local conditions in Puget Sound (Washington, USA) during the spring and summer, and suggest that declines in marine survival since the 1980s may have been caused by reductions in the quality of feeding and growing conditions during early marine life.},

abstract = {Predation mortality can influence the distribution and abundance of fish populations. While predation is often assessed using direct observations of prey consumption, potential predation can be predicted from co-occurring predator and prey densities under varying environmental conditions. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. (i.e., smolts) from the Columbia River Basin experience elevated mortality during the transition from estuarine to ocean habitat, but a thorough understanding of the role of predation remains incomplete. We used a Holling type II functional response to estimate smolt predation risk based on observations of piscivorous seabirds (sooty shearwater [Ardenna griseus] and common murre [Uria aalge]) and local densities of alternative prey fish including northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in Oregon and Washington coastal waters during May and June 2010-2012. We evaluated predation risk relative to the availability of alternative prey and physical factors including turbidity and Columbia River plume area, and compared risk to returns of adult salmon. Seabirds and smolts consistently co-occurred at sampling stations throughout most of the study area (mean = 0.79 ± 0.41, SD), indicating that juvenile salmon are regularly exposed to avian predators during early marine residence. Predation risk for juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), yearling Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and subyearling Chinook salmon was on average 70% lower when alternative prey were present. Predation risk was greater in turbid waters, and decreased as water clarity increased. Juvenile coho and yearling Chinook salmon predation risk was lower when river plume surface areas were greater than 15,000 km2, while the opposite was estimated for subyearling Chinook salmon. These results suggest that plume area, turbidity, and forage fish abundance near the mouth of the Columbia River, all of which are influenced by river discharge, are useful indicators of potential juvenile salmon mortality that could inform salmonid management.},

abstract = {The Northern California Current (NCC) is a seasonally productive and open ecosystem. It is home to both a diverse endemic community and to seasonally transient species. Productivity and food web structure vary seasonally, interannually, and decadally due to variability in coastal upwelling, climate-scale physical processes, and the migratory species entering the system. The composition of the pelagic community varies between years, including changes to mid-trophic level groups that represent alternate energy-transfer pathways between lower and upper trophic levels (forage fishes, euphausiids, jellyfish). Multiple data sets, including annual spring and summer mesoscale surveys of the zooplankton, pelagic fish, and seabird communities, were used to infer NCC trophic network arrangements and develop end-to-end models for each of the 2003-2007 upwelling seasons. Each model was used to quantify the interannual variability in energy-transfer efficiency from bottom to top trophic levels. When each model was driven under an identical nutrient input rate, substantial differences in the energy available to each functional group were evident. Scenario analyses were used to examine the roles of forage fishes, euphausiids, and jellyfish (small gelatinous zooplankton and large carnivorous jellyfish) as alternate energy transfer pathways. Euphausiids were the more important energy transfer pathway; a large proportion of the lower trophic production consumed was transferred to higher trophic levels. In contrast, jellyfish acted as a production loss pathway; little of the production consumed was passed upwards. Analysis of the range of ecosystem states observed interannually and understanding system sensitivity to variability among key trophic groups improves our ability to predict NCC ecosystem response to short- and long-term environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Research on regulatory mechanisms in biological populations often focuses on environmental covariates. An integrated approach that combines environmental indices with organismal-level information can provide additional insight on regulatory mechanisms. Survival of spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is consistently low whereas some adjacent populations with similar life histories experience greater survival. It is not known if populations with differential survival respond similarly during early marine residence, a critical period in the life history. Ocean collections, genetic stock identification, and otolith analyses were combined to evaluate the growth-mortality and matchmismatch hypotheses during early marine residence of spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon. Interannual variation in juvenile attributes, including size at marine entry and marine growth rate, was compared with estimates of survival and physical and biological metrics. Multiple linear regression and multi-model inference were used to evaluate the relative importance of biological and physical metrics in explaining interannual variation in survival. There was relatively weak support for the match-mismatch hypothesis and stronger evidence for the growth-mortality hypothesis. Marine growth and size at capture were strongly, positively related to survival, a finding similar to spring Chinook salmon from the Mid-Upper Columbia River. In hindcast models, basin-scale indices (Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)) and biological indices (juvenile salmon catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and a copepod community index (CCI)) accounted for substantial and similar portions of variation in survival for juvenile emigration years 1998-2008 (R2> 0.70). However, in forecast models for emigration years 2009-2011, there was an increasing discrepancy between predictions based on the PDO (50-448% of observed value) compared with those based on the NPGO (68-212%) or biological indices (CPUE and CCI: 83-172%). Overall, the PDO index was remarkably informative in earlier years but other basin-scale and biological indices provided more accurate indications of survival in recent years. {\textcopyright} 2014 Miller et al.},

The data were obtained by an extensive literature search that yielded 788 paired rate estimates of autotrophic growth ($\mu$) and microzooplankton grazing (m) from dilution experiments. From studies in which phytoplankton standing stock was measured in terms of carbon equivalents, we show that the production estimate from dilution experiments is a reasonable proxy (r = 0.89) for production determined by the standard 14C method. The ratio m:$\mu$, the proportion of primary production (PP) consumed by micrograzers, shows that microzooplankton consumption is the main source of phytoplankton mortality in the oceans, accounting for 67% of phytoplankton daily growth for the full data set. This ratio varies modestly among various marine habitats and regions, with data averages ranging from 60% for coastal and estuarine environments to 70% for the open oceans, and from ∼59% for temperate-subpolar and polar systems to 75% for tropical-subtropical regions. Given estimates for the metabolic requirements of micrograzers and assuming they consume most bacterial production, regionally averaged estimates of the protistan respiration are 35-43% of daily PP for the first level of consumer or 49-59% of PP for three trophic transfers. The estimated contributions of microbial grazers to total community respiration are of the same magnitude as bacterial respiration. Consequently, potential ecosystem differences in micrograzer activity or trophic structure are a large uncertainty for biogeochemical models that seek to predict the microbial community role in carbon cycling from bacterial parameters alone.},

abstract = {Captive rearing and translocation are often used concurrently for species conservation, yet the effects of these practices can interact and lead to unintended outcomes that may undermine species' recovery efforts. Controls in translocation or artificial-propagation programs are uncommon; thus, there have been few studies on the interacting effects of these actions and environmental conditions on survival. The Columbia River basin, which drains 668,000 km2 of the western United States and Canada, has an extensive network of hydroelectric and other dams, which impede and slow migration of anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and can increase mortality rates. To mitigate for hydrosystem-induced mortality during juvenile downriver migration, tens of millions of hatchery fish are released each year and a subset of wild- and hatchery-origin juveniles are translocated downstream beyond the hydropower system. We considered how the results of these practices interact with marine environmental conditions to affect the marine survival of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha). We analyzed data from more than 1 million individually tagged fish from 1998 through 2006 to evaluate the probability of an individual fish returning as an adult relative to its rearing (hatchery vs. wild) and translocation histories (translocated vs. in-river migrating fish that traveled downriver through the hydropower system) and a suite of environmental variables. Except during select periods of very low river flow, marine survival of wild translocated fish was approximately two-thirds less than survival of wild in-river migrating fish. For hatchery fish, however, survival was roughly two times higher for translocated fish than for in-river migrants. Competition and predator aggregation negatively affected marine survival, and the magnitude of survival depended on rearing and translocation histories and biological and physical conditions encountered during their first few weeks of residence in the ocean. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interacting effects of translocation, artificial propagation, and environmental variables on the long-term viability of species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {We used microsatellite DNA data and genetic stock identification methods to delineate the temporal and spatial distributions of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha occupying coastal habitats extending from central Oregon to northern Washington. Juveniles were collected in trawl surveys conducted during spring, summer, and autumn over 15 years. Distributions (mean latitude and distance from shore) differed between  yearling and subyearling life history types and between stocks; many of these differences were consistent across years. Yearlings were nearly all (98%) from Columbia River sources, and only 6% were naturally produced. In late May, yearlings from the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers were farther north than other yearlings, likely due to the early spring timing of their releases from hatcheries and subsequent out-migration from the Columbia River However, yearling distributions in late June reflected known migration behaviors. Yearlings from interior Columbia and Snake River sources were farthest north by June, whereas yearlings from other stocks were more spread out in latitude. Subyearlings sampled in early summer were also largely from the Columbia River (98%), but greater percentages of subyearlings from coastal rivers were present during the fall (24%). In contrast to  yearlings, natural production accounted for nearly one-third of subyearlings. Subyearlings of most stocks tended toremain relatively near their point of sea entry throughout the summer. Subyearlings from the Snake River fall-run stock and upper Columbia River summer-fall-run stock exhibited diverse distributions that included both southward and northward dispersal. Overall, distributions of Chinook Salmon stocks and life history types reflected differences in migration behavior but also reflected the influence of environmental factors and hatchery practices.},

abstract = {We evaluated the relative importance of "bottom-up" (production-limited) and "top-down" (predator-mediated) processes during early marine residence in a population of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Columbia River, USA. We examined length, mass, and condition index of age-0 juveniles collected in the ocean during June and September across 11 years in relation to conditions in the river, estuary, and coastal ocean and to future adult returns. Characteristics of juveniles in September, but not June, were related to adult returns. During years when coastal waters were relatively cool and productive, juveniles captured in September displayed relatively low condition and reduced otolith growth compared with years when coastal waters were relatively warm and unproductive; this contrast indicates that top-down effects such as selective mortality or competition are important during early marine residence. Key physical (river plume volume during emigration) and biological (condition) variables and their interaction accounted for >95% of the variation in adult returns. Future research should focus on evaluating predators and competitors and understanding how river plume structure influences survival.},

abstract = {Yearling Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were sampled concurrently with physical variables (temperature, salinity, depth) and biological variables (chlorophyll a concentration and copepod abundance) along the Washington and Oregon coast in June 1998-2008. Copepod species were divided into four different groups based on their water-type affinities: cold neritic, subarctic oceanic, warm neritic, and warm oceanic. Generalized linear mixed models were used to quantify the relationship between the abundance of these four different copepod groups and the abundance of juvenile salmon. The relationships between juvenile salmon and different copepod groups were further validated using regression analysis of annual mean juvenile salmon abundance versus the mean abundance of the copepod groups. Yearling Chinook salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with cold neritic copepods, subarctic copepods, and chlorophyll a concentration. The selected habitat variables explained 67% of the variation in yearling Chinook abundance. Yearling coho salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with temperature. The selected habitat variables explained 40% of the variation in yearling coho abundance. Results suggest that copepod communities can be used to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of abundance of juvenile salmon, i.e., large-scale interannual variations in ocean conditions (warm versus cold years) and inshore-offshore (cross-shelf) gradients in the abundance of juvenile salmon can be characterized by differences in the abundance of copepod species with various water mass affinities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Now recent technological advances add to an overwhelming body of evidence for another paradigm shift in terms of the role of gelatinous plankton (jellyfish) in marine food webs. Traditionally viewed as trophic dead ends, stable isotope analysis of predator tissues, animal-borne cameras, and DNA analysis of fecal and gut samples (metabarcoding) are all indicating that many taxa routinely consume jellyfish. Despite their low energy density, the contribution of jellyfish to the energy budgets of predators may be much greater than assumed because of rapid digestion, low capture costs, availability, and selective feeding on the more energy-rich components. Feeding on jellyfish may make marine predators susceptible to ingestion of plastics.},

abstract = {Variations in marine prey availability and nutritional quality can affect juvenile salmon growth and survival during early ocean residence. Salmon growth, and hence survival, may be related to the onset of piscivory, but there is limited knowledge on the interplay between the prey field, environment, and salmon ontogeny. Subyearling Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and their potential prey were sampled in coastal waters off Willapa Bay, USA to explore this issue. Three seasonal prey assemblages were identified, occurring in spring (May), early summer (June – July), and late summer (August – September). The onset of piscivory, based on salmon stomach contents, fatty acids, and stable isotopes occurred later in 2011 compared to 2012, and coincided with the appearance of Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Salmon fork length (FL) and carbon isotope values ($\delta$13C) increased with a fatty acid biomarker for marine phytoplankton and decreased with a freshwater marker, indicating dietary carbon sources changed as salmon emigrated from the Columbia River. Salmon FL also increased with nitrogen isotope ratios ($\delta$15N), trophic position, and a fatty acid marker for piscivory – a consequence of the ontogenetic shift in diet to fish. Salmon grew faster and obtained larger size and condition by September 2011 compared to 2012, which was related to inter-annual differences in ocean conditions and the duration over which Northern Anchovy were available. Our results support the idea that juvenile salmon growth depends on the onset and duration of piscivory, suggesting both of these factors may be important components of lifetime growth and fitness.},

In this review and prospectus, we summarize key findings from this program and describe a plan for transitioning it to better support Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM). While we focus on salmon research, our approach applies to research design generally. Our path forward involves increasing understanding of ecosystem processes to improve the dependability of scenario testing under novel conditions. Over the past two decades, we developed a conceptual model for how climate, predators, prey, fisheries, and human activities influence salmon. Knowledge gaps we identified from our conceptual model include limited understanding of salmon distributions, behavior, maturation dynamics, and population dynamics, and salmon interactions with predators, competitors, and prey during winter. We consider emerging risks and vulnerabilities facing salmon and propose analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Increased predator populations, coupled with climate change, pose increasing threats to West Coast salmon and will require new strategies and actions to mitigate their negative impacts. We propose research to support the development of decision-support tools to evaluate tradeoffs associated with alternative management strategies and to inform an adaptive ecosystem management system to improve the resilience of salmon populations and salmon-dependent fisheries.},

We compare ecosystem models parameterized before and after the onset of recent marine heatwaves to evaluate the cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. While the ecosystem-level contribution (prey) and demand (predators) of most functional groups changed following the heatwaves, gelatinous taxa experienced the largest transformations, underscored by the arrival of northward-expanding pyrosomes.

In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50°N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15-25°N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5°N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we use generalized additive mixed models to evaluate the relationship between an epipelagic fish community in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and oceanographic predictor variables, quantified in situ as well as via remote-sensing. We demonstrate the utility of using MODIS Rrs555 fields at monthly and interannual timescales to better understand how freshwater input into the Northern California Current region affects higher trophic level biology. These relationships also allow us to identify a gradient in community composition characteristic of warmer, offshore areas and cooler, nearshore areas over the period 2003–2012, and predict community characteristics outside of sampled species data from 2013 to 2015. These spatial maps therefore represent a new, temporally and spatially explicit index of community differences, potentially useful for filling gaps in regional ecosystem status reports and is germane to the broader ecosystem-based fisheries management context.},

During the springs and summers of 1998‐2004, we collected predator and prey fishes (forage and juvenile salmonids) at the surface at night off the mouth of the Columbia River. Pacific hake Merluccius productus had relatively low percentages of empty stomachs during cool‐ocean years (2000 through 2002) and high percentages during 1998, a warm‐ocean year. Euphausiids and fishes were the most commonly eaten prey for both species. Pacific hake and jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus appeared to show some diet selectivity, eating some fish, including salmonids, in a higher proportion than found in the environment. Both Pacific hake and jack mackerel ate juvenile salmonids, but at very low amounts. After considering population sizes in the study area, these two predators do not appear to be responsible for the death of large numbers of Columbia River juvenile salmon smolts. However, we may have underestimated the number of salmonids eaten by hake and mackerel due to the limitations of our study. More work needs to be done to identify and quantify predation of juvenile salmon off the Pacific Northwest. },

Here, we used otolith microstructure and chemistry to examine the factors potentially linked to selective mortality of juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from California's Central Valley during early ocean residence. Back-calculated size and growth rates of the population were compared across 3 sample periods: as juveniles exited the San Francisco Bay estuary (estuary-exit), after their first month at sea (summer-ocean) and 5 mo after ocean entry (fall-ocean). We compared mortality dynamics during years of exceptional recruitment (addition of individuals to harvestable population; 2000 and 2001) to a year of poor recruitment (2005). Otoliths from 2005 were also analyzed for sulfur isotopes to discern hatchery from naturally spawned stock. Significant size and growth-rate selective mortality were detected during the first month at sea in the low recruitment year of 2005, but not in 2000 and 2001. Individuals that were larger and growing faster during freshwater and estuarine rearing were more likely to survive to summer and fall in the low recruitment year. There was a slight, but insignificant, increase in the proportion of hatchery to naturally spawned individuals from estuary-exit to fall-ocean, suggesting that fish from neither origin were overwhelmingly favored. Our results suggest that Central Valley Chinook salmon can be subject to significant size and growth-rate selective mortality resulting in low adult abundance, and this mortality appears independent of origin. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

We developed an individual-based model (IBM) for E. pacifica to study its bioenergetics (growth, stage development, reproduction, and mortality) under constant/ideal conditions as well as under varying ocean conditions and food resources. To model E. pacifica under varying conditions, we coupled the IBM to an oceanographic-ecosystem model over the period 2000-2008 (9 years). Model results under constant/ideal food conditions compare favorably with experimental studies conducted under food unlimited conditions. Under more realistic variable oceanographic conditions, mean growth rates over the continental shelf were positive only when individuals migrated diurnally to the depth of maximum phytoplankton layer during nighttime feeding. Our model only used phytoplankton as prey and coastal growth rates were lower than expected (0.01 mmd-1), suggesting that a diverse prey base (zooplankton, protists, marine snow) may be required to facilitate growth and survival of modeled E. pacifica in the coastal environment. This coupled IBM-ROMS modeling framework and its parameters provides a tool for understanding the biology and ecology of E. pacifica and could be developed to further the understanding of climatic effects on this key prey species and enhance an ecosystem approach to fisheries and wildlife management in this region.},

abstract = {1. Geostatistical data-spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon-are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate. 2. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE-(stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software. 3. We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization). 4. We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

abstract = {Objective: The study was designed to assess long-term variability in the distribution of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria. The study also evaluated whether Sablefish and Pacific salmon shared food resources and looked to characterize Sablefish during an understudied period of their life cycle. Methods: To meet the objectives, the study used data from 26 years of surface trawls conducted in Oregon and Washington coastal waters (1998–2023). Spatial–temporal models were used to measure changes in abundance and distribution of Pacific salmon and Sablefish along with covariates of ocean temperature. The study evaluated trophic characteristics of Pacific salmon and Sablefish from 2020 for differences. The temporal variation in size and diets of Sablefish were also analyzed, along with energy density of fish caught in 2020. Result: The spatial–temporal model demonstrated that there has been a nearshore expansion of juvenile Sablefish over the past 26 years that was correlated with increased ocean temperature. The nearshore expansion of Sablefish resulted in increased spatial and trophic overlap with juvenile Pacific salmon. While feeding in nearshore waters, juvenile Sablefish demonstrated competitive feeding advantages over juvenile Pacific salmon during a critical phase of salmonid early marine life history. Juvenile Sablefish exhibited significant ontogenetic diet and energetic shifts, and even the smallest (68–80 mm fork length) were piscivorous. Conclusions: If juvenile Sablefish numbers continue to increase relative to Pacific salmon, they could exert more competitive pressure, especially if food resources become limited. Pacific salmon may experience adverse effects from competition, regardless of whether or not juvenile Sablefish, which have recently expanded into nearshore waters, successfully recruit to the adult population.},

abstract = {Selection of prey that are small and in poor body condition is a widespread phenomenon in terrestrial predator-prey systems and may benefit prey populations by removing substandard individuals. Similar selection is widely assumed to operate in aquatic systems. Indeed, size-selective predation is a longstanding and central tenet of aquatic food web theory. However, it is not known if aquatic predators select prey based on their condition or state, compared to their size. Surprisingly, no comparable information is available for marine systems because it is exceedingly difficult to make direct observations in this realm. Thus the role of body condition in regulating susceptibility to predation remains a black box in the marine environment. Here we have exploited an ideal model system to evaluate selective predation on pelagic marine fish: comparing characteristics (fork length, mass corrected for fork length) of fresh, whole, intact juvenile Pacific salmon delivered by a seabird to its single nestling with salmon collected concurrently in coastal trawl surveys. Three species of juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are consumed by provisioning Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata); an abundant, colonial, pursuitdiving seabird. Samples were collected from multiple colonies and fisheries surveys in coastal British Columbia in two years. As predicted, Auklets preyed on small individuals in poor condition and consistently selected them at levels higher than their relative availability. This is the first study to provide direct evidence for both size- and condition-selective predation on marine fish in the wild. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point in evaluating how selective predation may structure or influence marine fish populations and bridges a fundamental incongruity between ecological theory and application; although "bigger is better" is considered a fundamental tenet of marine food webs, marine predators are often assumed to consume indiscriminately.},

abstract = {Background: Studies that attempt to measure shifts in species distributions often consider a single species in isolation. However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator–prey overlap metrics: Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator–prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study: We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator–prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions: Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator–prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

However, climate impacts are so complex, and the literature on salmon and trout is so vast that researchers and decision makers scramble to make sense of it all. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of climate impacts on salmon and anadromous trout as a resource for stakeholders, managers, and researchers. We reviewed studies published from 2010 to 2021 that address climate impacts on these fish and organized them in a database of 1169 physical and 1853 biological papers. Papers are labeled with keywords across eight categories related to subject matter and study methods. We compared the literature by biological process and life stage and used these comparisons to assess strengths and weaknesses. We then summarized expected phenotypic and genetic responses and management actions by life stage. Overall, we found the largest research gaps related to species interactions, behavioral responses, and effects that carry over across life stages. With this collection of the literature, we can better apply scarce conservation resources, fill knowledge gaps, and make informed decisions that do not ignore uncertainty.},

abstract = {Predictions of the distribution of groundfish species are needed to support ongoing marine spatial planning initiatives in Canadian Pacific waters. Data to inform species distribution models are available from several fishery-independent surveys. However, no single survey covers the entire region and different gear types are required to survey the range of relevant habitat. Here, we demonstrated a method for integrating presence–absence data across surveys and gear types that allows us to predict the coastwide distributions of 65 groundfish species in British Columbia. Our model leverages data from multiple surveys to estimate how species respond to environmental gradients while accounting for differences in survey catchability. We find that this method has two main benefits: (1) it increases the accuracy of predictions in data-limited surveys and regions while having negligible impacts on accuracy when data are already sufficient, and (2) it reduces uncertainty, resulting in tighter confidence intervals on predicted occurrences. These benefits are particularly relevant in areas of our coast where our understanding of habitat suitability is limited due to a lack of spatially comprehensive long-term groundfish surveys.},

Coincident with this marine heat wave, we documented unprecedented biological changes in plankton and nekton in the Northern California Current (NCC) within pelagic surveys conducted over 20 years (1998–2017). The recent warm period was dominated by warmwater gelatinous invertebrates and fishes, some of which were previously either extremely rare or absent. Mixing of organisms originating from more southern or western regions with those previously present in the NCC may have resulted in novel and unpredictable trophic interactions that produced some of the observed changes in relative abundance. Continued long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether this is a temporary ecosystem disturbance or a fundamental change in the very productive NCC upwelling region.},

abstract = {Due to spatio-temporal variability of lower trophic-level productivity along the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), predators must be capable of switching prey or foraging areas in response to changes in environmental conditions and available forage. The Gulf of the Farallones in central California represents a biodiversity hotspot and contains the largest common murre (Uria aalge) colonies along the CCE. During spring, one of the West Coast's most important Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations out-migrates into the Gulf of the Farallones. We quantify the effect of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon associated with ecosystem-level variability by integrating long-term time series of environmental conditions (upwelling, river discharge), forage species abundance within central CCE, and population size, at-sea distribution, and diet of the common murre. Our results demonstrate common murres typically forage in the vicinity of their offshore breeding sites, but in years in which their primary prey, pelagic young-of-year rockfish (Sebastes spp.), are less available they forage for adult northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) nearshore. Incidentally, while foraging inshore, common murre consumption of out-migrating juvenile Chinook salmon, which are collocated with northern anchovy, increases and population survival of the salmon is significantly reduced. Results support earlier findings that show timing and strength of upwelling, and the resultant forage fish assemblage, is related to Chinook salmon recruitment variability in the CCE, but we extend those results by demonstrating the significance of top-down impacts associated with these bottom-up dynamics. Our results demonstrate the complexity of ecosystem interactions and impacts between higher trophic-level predators and their prey, complexities necessary to quantify in order to parameterize ecosystem models and evaluate likely outcomes of ecosystem management options.},

abstract = {Experiences of migratory species in one habitat may affect their survival in the next habitat, in what is known as carryover effects. These effects are especially relevant for understanding how freshwater experience affects survival in anadromous fishes. Here, we study the carryover effects of juvenile salmon passage through a hydropower system (Snake and Columbia rivers, northwestern United States). To reduce the direct effect of hydrosystem passage on juveniles, some fishes are transported through the hydrosystem in barges, while the others are allowed to migrate in-river. Although hydrosystem survival of transported fishes is greater than that of their run-of-river counterparts, their relative juvenile-to-adult survival (hereafter survival) can be less. We tested for carryover effects using generalized linear mixed effects models of survival with over 1 million tagged Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum) (Salmonidae), migrating in 1999–2013. Carryover effects were identified with rear-type (wild vs. hatchery), passage-type (run-of-river vs. transported), and freshwater and marine covariates. Importantly, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index characterizing cool/warm (i.e., productive/nonproductive) ocean phases had a strong influence on the relative survival of rear- and passage-types. Specifically, transportation benefited wild Chinook salmon more in cool PDO years, while hatchery counterparts benefited more in warm PDO years. Transportation was detrimental for wild Chinook salmon migrating early in the season, but beneficial for later season migrants. Hatchery counterparts benefited from transportation throughout the season. Altogether, wild fish could benefit from transportation approximately 2 weeks earlier during cool PDO years, with still a benefit to hatchery counterparts. Furthermore, we found some support for hypotheses related to higher survival with increased river flow, high predation in the estuary and plume areas, and faster migration and development-related increased survival with temperature. Thus, pre- and within-season information on local- and broad-scale conditions across habitats can be useful for planning and implementing real-time conservation programs.},
