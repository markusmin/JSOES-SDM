## Background

The factors that determine the marine survival and therefore recruitment of salmonid populations have long been of interest to ecologists and fisheries managers, and are a key determinant of the recovery of ESA-listed populations. Marine survival varies considerably both between salmon stocks and between years, as evinced by large variations in Smolt-to-Adult return (SAR) estimates [@Sharma2012]. This is evident in the Columbia River Basin, as seen in the following plots of SAR for three different populations:

Marine survival is complicated, and actually begins in freshwater.

##### However, recruitment in anadromous salmonids has the key difference from recruitment in marine species that these fish outmigrate as juveniles, and therefore the larval and early juvenile stages (where the majority of mortality occurs in marine species) are occurring in freshwater. Studies have found that there are considerable carryover effects from freshwater rearing that also impact marine survival. 

Scheuerell et al. (2009): 

For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4–50 times greater than
those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among
years, presumably reﬂecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and tro-
phic dynamics that aﬀect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage.



Once juveniles emigrate to the ocean, our conceptual understanding of marine survival is based primarily on the foundational work of @Pearcy1992 and @Beamish2001, who argued that marine survival is determined early in the oceanic phase, with survival being dependent on the ability to avoid predation and feed to satisfy metabolic requirements. An underlying and possibly unifying process that underlies marine survival is the "growth-mortality hypothesis" [@Anderson1988; @Miller1998], which states that growth of juvenile fish is a primary determinant of mortality, given that predation is often size-dependent. Multiple studies have found evidence to support this hypothesis for Columbia River salmon. Studies of marine survival in Snake River spring/summer [@Miller2014] and Columbia River spring Chinook salmon [@Tomaro2012] found that marine growth and size at capture were strongly positively related to survival, providing evidence for the growth-mortality hypothesis. Furthermore, direct evidence of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon by Pacific Hake and Jack Mackerel appears to support this hypothesis, as only small juvenile salmonids were found in predator stomachs [@Emmett2008].

Outgrowing size-dependent mortality and meeting metabolic needs are each ultimately related to food availability. In the classical recruitment literature, many hypotheses are put forward that describe the conditions necessary for fish to feed and grow. The first of these is known as the “match-mismatch hypothesis,” which states that the degree of spatiotemporal match or mismatch between fish and their prey leads to variable year class strength [@Cushing1975; @Cushing1990]. A second is the “Stable Ocean Hypothesis” as put forward by Reuben Lasker, which stated that it was not only the abundance of food, but also the degree of aggregation of food (which a stable, i.e., not turbulent, ocean was necessary for) that provided for good feeding conditions [@Lasker1981]. A third hypothesis, which is related to Lasker’s Stable Ocean Hypothesis, is the Optimal Environmental Window hypothesis [@Cury1989]. This states that in Ekman-type (wind-driven) upwelling systems, there exists an optimal window for larval and juvenile fish survival (and therefore recruitment). This optimal window is the result of the dome-shaped relationship between upwelling (which is related to turbulence) and recruitment. This is because at higher wind speeds, despite higher primary productivity, mixing begins to occur and disrupts the food aggregations necessary for larval fish to feed on, leading to a tradeoff between food availability and turbulence.

There have been multiple studies that have attempted to examine these hypotheses as they pertain to Columbia River salmonids, with mixed results. To test the match-mismatch hypothesis, @Tomaro2012 used four indicators: two indices of the copepod community based on sampling from the Newport Hydrographic Line (NHL), the lag between the physical spring transition date and juvenile emigration, and the lag between the biological spring transition date and juvenile emigration. They found no relationship between these four indicators and growth, did find a relationship between size at capture of juvenile salmonids and both the abundance of lipid-rich copepods and the timing of biological spring transition [@Tomaro2012]. In a similar study, @Miller2014 investigated the relationship between SAR and PDO, NPGO, an index of the copepod community from the NHL, the Columbia River Plume area, and the same lags between physical and biological transition dates and juvenile emigration. They found that some of these indicators performed well for hindcasting, but very poorly for forecasting [@Miller2014]. In a multivariate analysis of Columbia River Basin returns, @Burke2013 found that almost every indicator related to growth and feeding was informative, as were the PDO and ONI indices.

Across these studies, a major limitation is a lack of spatial information, as evinced by the coarse indicators used. While basin-scale indicators like PDO and NPGO have historically been useful for predicting salmon returns, these correlations appear to be breaking down [@Litzow2020]. As a result, spatially resolved data that better reflects the restricted and stock-specific areas used by juvenile salmon in their early marine residence [@Teel2015] may improve our mechanistic understanding of drivers of marine survival.

##### Additionally, ocean migration patterns need to be taken into account to resolve the spatiotemporal domain.
How much do CPS move throughout the year? How representative of their distributions are snapshots in July (CCES), for example?

It is also very important to consider the migration of juvenile salmon out of the study area, and that JSOES only provides a snapshot of this migration.


Multiple fisheries-independent surveys are operated in the Northern California Current that may provide an opportunity to uncover these mechanistic relationships. The first of these is the Juvenile Salmon and Ocean Ecosystem Survey (JSOES). The JSOES collects a lot of key information, and uses genetic methods to identify origin and rear type. It's a great data source to start with for unraveling this problem. However, the JSOES survey provides insights into only certain elements of the Northern California Current food web. Other datasets need to be integrated to be able to take a holistic look at marine survival, which are described under the "Survey Descriptions" tab. Using species distribution models fit to these data, spatiotemporal overlap between juvenile salmonids, their predators, competitors, and prey can be estimated.




##### Conclude with a description of our study and why it's cool
What's new and interesting about our methods? 1) Using SDMs, whereas past studies typically just looked by station; 2) we're trying to combine datasets, most past analyses are isolated to their surveys. Some studies (e.g., Friedman et al. 2018) combine RREAS and PRS surveys, since they have similar sampling methods and target taxa, but are in different spatial areas. This study is different because we look at multiple surveys conducted in the same area, which gives us the advantage of looking at taxa across trophic levels.
