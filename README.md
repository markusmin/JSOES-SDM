# JSOES-SDM

Please note that some data files are not uploaded to this repository due to sharing restrictions. If you would like to reproduce this analysis and require the input data files, please reach out directly and I can put you in touch with the survey data managers.

This repository is under development. At this point in time, the most useful files are the following:

- R/JSOES_make_mesh.R creates the bespoke SPDE mesh for the JSOES domain needed for the SDMs
- R/sdmTMB_demo.Rmd demonstrates model fitting using the custom mesh for JSOES
